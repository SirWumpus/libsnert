Parallel Domain Query API Overview
----------------------------------

Order of operations
-------------------

  1.	pdqInit called once when application starts up.

  2.	Set global PDQ options:

		pdqInitialTimeout
		pdqMaxTimeout
		pdqSetDebug
		pdqSetShortQuery
		pdqSetRoundRobin
		pdqSetSourcePortRandomisation

  3.	Create a new PDQ context with pdqOpen. PDQ is thread safe.

  4.	Modify context options:

		pdqSetTimeout		change max. timeout
		pdqSetBasicQuery	change short-query
		pdqSetLinearQuery   	change round robin

  5.	Post one or more queries using pdqQuery, which builds and send
	the query to one or more name servers, depending on the
	context's round robin setting (default is parallel).

  6.	Collect answers using pdqWait or pdqWaitAll. pdqWait collects
	any waiting answers or timeouts and returns. pdqWaitAll collects
	answers until all pending queries have been resolved or timed
	out.

	pdqWait and pdqWaitAll return a list of PDQ_rr pointers. There
	are a family of pdqList* functions for manipulation and pruning
	of the returned list.

	Each PDQ_rr structure contains a PDQ_RCODE_* result from the
	result given by a name server. In the case of an error case, the
	first member of the list of PDQ_rr pointers (typically) contains
	a pseudo PDQ_rr that carries just the PDQ_RCODE_* result.

	Note that pdqWait and pdqWaitAll are wrapper functions that
	handle exponential backoff timeout and calling pdqPoll.

  7.	The PDQ context can be reused several times. When using pdqWait,
	pdqQueryRemoveAll is used to remove any pending queries no
	longer of interest. The application can then repeat steps 4, 5, 6,
	and 7.

  8.	Dispose of a PDQ context using pdqClose.

  9.	pdqFini called when the application shuts down.


There are two family of helper functions:

	pdqFetch* family is a wrapper that simply calls pdqOpen, pdqGet*,
	and pdqClose.

	pdqGet* family wraps the pdqQuery, pdqWaitAll, and common post
	processing such as extra queries, pruning, and error handling.

	pdqGet			pdqFetch
	pdqGet5A		pdqFetch5A
	pdqGetMX		pdqFetchMX
	pdqGetDnsList		pdqFetchDnsList

	The dnsList API makes use of pdqGetDnsList. See dnsList-api.txt.

	The pdqSetShortQuery(1) and pdqSetBasicQuery(pdq, 1) disables
	subordinate lookups for A/AAAA records for MX, NS, and SOA in
	pdqGet. pdqSetShortQuery(0) and pdqSetBasicQuery(pdq, 0) enables
	the normal behaviour for pdqGet.

Note that these helper functions, while handling certain common post
processing issues, do not provide true asynchronous behaviour. True
asynchronous would require the application doing the lower level
operations itself (pdqQuery, pdqWait / pdqWaitAll, post processing).

There are also a special root search function, pdqRootGet, which handles
the complexities of searching from the root servers for an authoritative
answer. This is not truely asynchronous either.
