The major number changes for such things as code rewrites, changes in
syntax, and/or dramatic changes in functionality. The minor number
changes for corrections, enhancements, etc. made to the code. There
is no set schedule for releases.

--TODO--

   +	smdb.c: parseCfAliasFile() should support multiple AliasFile
	options and database access type as described in the Bat Book
	3e. Requested by Didi Rieder.

   +	Add an API that returns a vector of all the IP addresses,
	machine name aliases, from across all interfaces.

   +	With gcc 4.0 or -fstrict-aliasing turned on kvm.c reports
   	several warning concerning the (DBT185 *) pointer casts. This
   	should be fixed probably with a union type for dual mode, and
   	the proper type without casts for db 1.85.

   ?	mcc: pthread_exit/pthread_cancel portability issues to Win32.

   ?	mcc: appears to hang on exit when input piped from standard in.

   ?	Consider a TextFind2. Brain storm...

   	a) that supports a regex-like subset and single character backreferences
   	b) shortest match instead of longest
   	c) parse on the fly
   	d) ^ $ anchors, . ? wild cards, * + (long match), # ~ (short match),
   	   < > word boundaries,
        e) \w \W word chars, \d \D digits, \s \S whitespace, and other predefined
           classes with a special design that treats them like "(\w)" so that
           backreferences could be done on single characters;
           \p \P punctuation, \x \X hex digits,
	f) no ( ) or { } to avoid recusion issues

	As long as you have enough puntuation characters for special operations,
	you can parse in real time. Actually if you drop the longest match and only
	use first/shortest match, you simplify things and you can drop the +
	operator since you can do "a+" as "aa*"

	*** To be refined. (ARSE = anthony's reduced search expressions)

--1.72.0--

   +	Added time62EncodeTime, time62DecodeTime.

   +	Added TextFindQuote to quote TextFind's meta characters.

   !	TextFind: fixed handling of backslash literal, in particular "\[".

--1.71.6--

   !	dnsListQueryMail changed to accept a list of domains for which
   	to test against MAIL BLs, typically free mail services.

   +	uri.c: added -M option for list of limited domains for which
   	to test againts MAIL BLs given by -m. Default is "*".

   !	TextFind: fixed bug when pattern is simply "*".

--1.71.5--

   +	Add dnsListQueryMail for querying EMAIL BL.

   +	uri.c, uri.txt, uri.txt.out: Add -m mail-bl option to uri tool.

   !	uriParse2: when parsing a mail address, the schemeInfo was corrupt.

   !	NULL pointer guards for Text*EndsWith and Text*StartsWith.

--1.71.4--

   *    Do NOT upgrade SQLite to 3.6.14; it has broken configure script.

   !	uriParse2: added check to distinguish between schemes that can
	have an empty value (about:) and those that require a value
	(http://blah/). Requested by Alex Broens.

   !	spanIP: fixed to take into account IPv6 address within square
   	brackets, eg. [2001:0DB8::1234]

   !	uri.txt.out: updated to account for the uriParse2 and spanIP
   	fixes.

   !	dnsListQueryNs0: was recursing if both NS and an SOA was returned
	with the initial NS lookup. This would incorrectly cause a 2nd
	lookup on the SOA domain.

--1.71.3--

  !!	mime.c/h: Fixes following the complete overhaul to maintain
	backwards compatibility behaviour of mime_decoded_octet hook.
	This was being done just before flushing the decode buffer, but
	that caused problems in how the uri, milter-link, and smtpf
	detected potential URI; they occasionally missed URI when there
	was more than one in the decode buffer. Fixed several decode
	newline issues. Added mime-eicar-test.sh regression test that
	checks both CRLF and LF newlines.

   !	mime-eicar-*.eml: changed to use GTUBE test file which won't
   	trigger AV scanners when emailing/downloading libsnert.

--1.71.2--

   !	uri.c: fixed uri CLI when parsing a URL that uses & delimiters
   	but no query string delimiter, eg.

   	http://dect.myspace.com/event.ng/Type=click&Redirect=http://pillenhaus.ch

   !	dnsListIsNameListed: fixed test to limit matches to 127.0.0.0/8
	or 0.0.0.0/8. Was testing the wrong value, which was in host
	byte order instead of network byte order. isReservedIPv4 would
	then convert the value to host byte order, thinking it was in
	network order, which of course reversed it.

--1.71.1--

   !	mimeStateBoundary: when crossing a MIME boundary issue an EOF
   	to force any cleanup, before starting the next MIME part.

   !	dnsListCreate: Assert that the DNS list suffixes are rooted, ie.
	terminated by a dot. This will prevent wildcard lookups when
	resolv.conf specifies a 'search domain.com' pragma and
	domain.com has a wildcard entry then any NXDOMAIN returns result
	in .domain.com being added to the end of the lookup and the
	wildcard being returned. Reported by Steve Freegard for
	netground.nl.

   !	dnsListIsNameListed: only return a match for values that are
   	either 127.0.0.0/8 or 0.0.0.0/8.

   !	uri.c: added "email:", "mail:", and "from:" as pusedo schemes to
	the schemes table in order to catch instances of:

		email:user@domain.com		(explicit)
	vs
		email: user@domain.com		(implicit)

   !	mime.c/h: complete overhaul of MIME API and testing tool to deal
	with several parsing and decoding bugs.

	The issues addressed by this major revision relate to a change
	in design assumptions made in previous builds by the decoupling
	of source and decode buffers. As a result several key points of
	RFC 2046 were no longer handled correctly.

	In particular RFC 2046 section 5.1.1

		The boundary delimiter line is then defined as a line
		consisting entirely of two hyphen characters ("-",
		decimal value 45) followed by the boundary parameter
		value from the Content-Type header field, optional
		linear whitespace, and a terminating CRLF.

		...

		The boundary delimiter MUST occur at the beginning of a
		line, i.e., following a CRLF, and the initial CRLF is
		considered to be attached to the boundary delimiter line
		rather than part of the preceding part.  The boundary
		may be followed by zero or more characters of linear
		whitespace. It is then terminated by either another CRLF
		and the header fields for the next part, or by two
		CRLFs, in which case there are no header fields for the
		next part.  If no Content-Type field is present it is
		assumed to be "message/rfc822" in a "multipart/digest"
		and "text/plain" otherwise.

		...

		boundary := 0*69<bchars> bcharsnospace

		bchars := bcharsnospace / " "

		bcharsnospace := DIGIT / ALPHA / "'" / "(" / ")" /
			      "+" / "_" / "," / "-" / "." /
			      "/" / ":" / "=" / "?"

	The lazy MIME boundary parsing excludes a boundary marker that
	is of zero length or starts with whitespace, eg.

		Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""

		Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=" foo bar"

	Ignoring zero length boundary markers ensures that email
	signatures, often delimited by a simple "--CRLF" (see
	Thunderbird MUA) or "-- CRLF" remain part of the content.

	Thus the following special cases had to be addressed carefully:

	a) Care with quoted-printable split line of hyphens, with a
	soft-line break, eg.

		\r\n
		-----------------------------------=\r\n
		-------\r\n

	These should not be treated as two boundaries.

	b) Care for signature line separator that should not be treated
	as a boundary even though it is valid, even when using quoted-
	printable.

		-- \r\n
	or
		--=20\r\n

	c) Care with a valid boundary line that looks like a quoted
	printable soft line break and with MIME parts that are
	quoted-printable encoded.

		\r\n
		--=__PartF0D8505D.0__=\r\n

	The mime-eicar-test.eml is crafted to test all of these special
	cases using the mime CLI tool.

--1.71.0--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.13; removed previous local patch.

   !	uriParse2: add support for file: scheme RFC 1738 section 3.10.

   !	uriParse2: add support for about: scheme based on comments in
   	RFC 3986 about schemes with empty scheme-info parts.

   !	dnsListQueryIP: added NULL guard to avoid spurious lookups when
   	there is no list.

   !	aclocal.m4: add 4.7 to the BDB version list.

   !	mime.c, uri.c: decouple source and decode buffer
	synchronisation. When they are synced and the content-encoding
	is Base64, then a newline in the source would flush the decode
	prematurely. Reported by Alex Broens.

   !	uri.c: Several changes for RFC 3986 which replaces RFC 2396.

   !	version.h.in.in, pdq.c: add debugging MEMSET macro to suppress
   	certain valgrind messages concerning uninitialised bytes.

   !	Updated the TLD list files.

   +	dnsList.c/h: Add dnsListLogOpen, dnsListLogClose, and dnsListLog.

   !	dnslist.c: updated dnsListQuery and dnsListQueryIP to log pass/fail
   	results to a separate file.

   +	Added BufAddSigned and BufAddUnsigned.

   !	BufAddBytes: removed offset argument, since this can be simply
   	done by adding the to pointer.

   +	Added TimeStampGMT.

   +	Added an HTTP request API.

   !	http.c, mime.c, echod.c, mimepart.c, digestbl.c, md4.c, md5.c:
	resolve many "signedness" warnings.

   !	spf.c: remove old Dns API code in favour of PDQ.

--1.70.11--

   !	mime.c: fix bug discovered through uri CLI; headers appear to be
   	parsed regardless of uri -a option. Reported by Alex Broens.

--1.70.10--

   +	option.c: added optionInitOption to initialise a single option.

--1.70.9--

   !	type/kvmap.c: allow kvmap to register keys with blank values using the
   	-b option.

   !	pdq.c: fix logic bug in guard test of the type passed to pdqListFindIP
   	and pdqListFindAddress.

   +	pdq.c/h: added pdqSectionName

   !	pdqLog, pdqDump output changed to include the section name from which
   	the RR came from. (See RFC 2308).


--1.70.8--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.10; removed previous local patch.

   +	Added pdqStringSize, pdqStringFormat, and pdqString.

   +	Added optionSetInteger.

   +	Added optionListAll to provide alternative means of writing the
   	options to standard output.

   !	Reimplemented optionUsage in terms of optionListAll.

   !	pdq.c/h: Added PDQ_section identifying the section the record
   	came from.

--1.70.7--

   +	dnsListQueryIP: added a function for IP BL queries, where a host's
   	A/AAAA records are first looked up then their IPs are checked
   	against IP BLs. This replaces the old uriIsHostBL.

   +	uri.c: added -i option to check URI host IP against IP BLs.

--1.70.6--

   !	Add redact option to htmlstrip CLI.

   !	Fixed htmlstrip to only process text/html sections.

   !	Assorted Windows/Mingw fixes for old Dns.h and struct timespec.

   +	pdq.c: added pdqIsValidSOA to validate basic characteristics of
   	na SOA.

   +	pdq.c: added -S option to validate an SOA of a domain.

   +	uri.c: added -s option to the CLI to do SOA validation

   !	uriParse2, uri.txt: change parsing of implicit domains/IP to
	only match if the implicit name starts with www. and ends with a
	valid TLD. This will exclude abbreviations like "U.S.A."; it
	will also ignore bare IP.

   !	hasValidTLD: now checks both level 1 and 2 TLD; previously it
   	only did level 1, while indexValidTLD checked both 1 and 2.

   !	dnsListQuery: skip testing names without a TLD.

   !	mime.c: Regression introduced in 1.70.5. mimeStateQpSoftLine
	would always set the state to mimeStateQpLiteral regardless of
	the current input character. This means a QP byte starting on
	the next line immediately following a softline break would not
	be correctly decoded. Example:

   		start with some text,=
   		=20soft line break, followed by a QP space

   	The =20 would not be decoded correctly.

   !	mime.c/h: renamed some Mime structure members to simplify
   	understanding and added more comments.

   !	mime.c/h, uri.c: Added a mime_flush hook. The UriMime handlers
	maintain a separate hold buffer for collecting a URI from the
	MIME source and decode buffers. When the MIME API flushes its
	buffers between lines, in particular between two header lines,
	when the previous line ends with something that is an URI, then
	the UriMime handlers were not previously notified of this
	transition via a CR or LF character. For example:

		To: dfg@fsg.com
		X-NLCID: 64556

	would result in a suggested URI of

		dfg@fsg.comX-NLCID

	With the mime_flush hook, uriMimeDecodeOctet can be called with
	a LF character to force a URI parse and flush. This results in
	the correct URI being reported:

		dfg@fsg.com

   +	Vector.c/h: added VectorUniq.

  !!	uriMimeDecodedOctet: fixed memory leak introduced when mime_flush
	was added.

--1.70.5--

   !	mime.c: fixed MIME boundary detection, when the first MIME
	boundary immediate follows the end of headers CRLF. See uri-
	samples/qp-long-one-line.eml for an example.

   !	mime.c/h: externalise mimeDecodeAdd; added mimeNoHeaders to
	switch initial state from message headers to content.

   !	mimeNextCh, mimeSourceLine: now handles EOF character code.

   !	mime.c: The CLI now signals EOF to the mimeNextCH to force the
	processing of the last source & decode buffers.

   !	mime.c: A quoted-printable soft line break no longer ends the
   	physcial input line.in terms of when mimeSourceLine. This should
   	reduce instances of a word being split across two lines.

   |	html.c:added htmlstrip CLI code.

   !	TokenNext: Fixed handling of single/double quoted string
	containing a double or single quote.

   !	htmlTokenRange: Fixed handling of single/double quoted string
	containing a double or single quote.

  !!	smtpRead: Fixed bogus string pointers when the SMTP response
	lines exceeded 10.

	Long standing bug. smtpRead allocates a table of string pointers
	and string buffer all as one block to simplify releasing the
	structure by the caller. When the number of response lines
	filled the table, the table and string buffer would be
	reallocated. Problem was that the table of string pointers
	pointed back to what are now unallocated strings.

	Now the table first saves only the string offsets from the start
	of the string buffer and once all response lines have been read
	we add in the string buffer base to each string offset. In
	addition, when we enlarge the number of rows in the string
	pointer table, we have to shift the read strings along to make
	room for the extra pointers added to the table.


--1.70.4--

   *	Revert back to SQLite 3.6.7 with associated patch.

   +	Added html.c/h an HTML tokeniser API.

--1.70.3--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.10; removed previous local patch.

   !	convertDate: Fixed parsing of RFC 2822/5322 date-time, which
	allow seconds to be optional. Reported by Christopher P. Lindsey.

--1.70.2--

   +	mime.c/h: added mimeBufferFlush.

   !	dnsList.c: added some NULL guards to dnsListQuery et al. when either
   	the dns_list or lookup name are NULL or empty strings.

--1.70.1--

   !	processDumpCore: OpenBSD/FreeBSD disabled the sysctl setting for
   	setuid dore dumping as this is a kernel setting and not per process.

   !	processDumpCore: now preforms the equivalent of "ulimit -S -c
	unlimited" to enable core dumps in addition to any ther settings.

   !	aclocal.m4: SNERT_INIT fixed quote handling on configure options (again).
   	Wrapping configure options within single quote, like --enable-debug
   	to '--enable-debug' creates a problem for autoconf reconfigure. Instead
   	place single quotes around assigned options, --with-option=value to
   	--with-option='value'.

--1.69.25-- aka 1.70.0

   *	Conversion to GIT source control management.

   !	Moved com/snert/include/com/snert/lib/* -> com/snert/src/lib/include
   	for GIT. Added symbolic link to maintin original structure.

   !	Moved com/snert/include/org/valgrind -> com/snert/src/lib/include
   	for GIT. Added symbolic link to maintin original structure.

   !	Moved com/snert/src/tools -> com/snert/src/lib/tools
   	for GIT. Added symbolic link to maintin original structure.

   !	tools/makefile.in: some path corrections for change in directory
   	structure.

   +	Add queue.c/h API for message queues between producer/consumer
   	threads.


--1.69.24--

   !	dnsListQueryNs: Changed lookup method.

	Problem in handling wnrl37.cheesereason.com. Version 1 did an
	initial SOA lookup wnrl37.cheesereason.com assuming the DNS
	server would return an SOA for the queried host or parent
	domain. This does not always appear to be the case. Example:

		dig soa wnrl37.cheesereason.com		SERVFAIL
		dig soa cheesereason.com		OK (SOA result)
		dig ns wnrl37.cheesereason.com    	OK (SOA result)
		dig ns cheesereason.com    		OK (NS list)

	However if you do a NS lookup and get an SOA result, then
	recurse once using the SOA domain. This still works fine for
	CNAME records, like www.snert.com.

   !	pdq.c/h: Added optDnsMaxTimeout and optDnsRoundRobin as global
   	options defined and supplied by PDQ API for consistency and
   	maintenance.

   !	mcc.c/h: replaced mcc_extra_t by mcc_hooks structure. Rearrange
	the hooks and data so that they are passed to mccCreate.
	Normally we'd assign the hooks immediately after mccCreate, but
	the prepare and finalise hooks need to be declared for mccCreate
	and mcc_sql_recreate. The expire hook should be defined before
	mccStartGc is called.

--1.69.23--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.7

   +	Added valgrind headers to libsnert manifest.

   +	Added net/getRFC2821DateTime.c.

   +	Added net/server.c API based on hibachi and smtpf.

   !	socketTimeoutIO.c: added support for use of clock_gettime instead
   	of gettimeofday when possible.

   !	timer.h: moved extern for timespec* and timeval* functions out of
   	the #ifdef blocks.

   +	timer.h. timespec.c, timeval.c: added timespecSet and timevalSet.

   +	Added a generalised threaded net/server.c API based on the design
   	used by smtpf and hibachi.

   !	getopt.c/g: additional portability fixes for Windows.

   +	pdq.c: added pdqListPrune5A and pdqListPruneMatch as separate
   	functions to provide more granularity. Reimplemented pdqListPrune
   	in terms of these new functions.

   !	pdqListFindIP, pdqFindAddress, pdqFindHost: functions should
	only attempt to find records that with an PDQ_RCODE_OK,
	otherwise a bus error or seg.fault might occur if we test value
	fields outside of an incomplete result.

   !	pdqListFindIP, pdqListFindAddress, pdqListFindHost: minor
	corrections to limit the possible types that can be used in the
	search

   +	pdq.c/h: added pdqGetAddress as a convience function for printing
   	an A/AAAA address found using pdqListFineName.

--1.69.22--

   !	uri.c, dnsList.c/h: moved the dnsList* functions into their own
   	API since the same code is used in uri CLI, milter-link, and
   	BarricadeMX.

--1.69.21--

   !	uri.c: fixed minor bug in process() the list name returned by
	nsListLookup was being saved to the wrong variable.

   !	uri.c: Removed old Dns client code. PDQ is now the one and only.

   +	Copied OpenBSD's /usr/include/sysexits.h to com/snert/lib/sys,
   	since the MINGW build environment doesn't supply sysexits.h.

   +	version.h.in.in: added QUOTE and QUOTE_THIS macros.

   !	spf.c, pdq.c, uri.c: documented CLI exit codes in usage text.

   !	alt_flock: fix handling of LOCK_NB.

--1.69.20--

   !	pidSave, pidLock, pidUnlock: Fixed pid file locking semantics.

   !	uri.c: enhanced CLI to test URI and/or NS BL lists. Renamed -d
   	option by -u and added -n option. Requested by April Lorenzen.

--1.69.19--

   !	mcc.c/h: Added call-back hooks hook_expire, hook_remote_replace, and
   	hook_remote_remove to allow some control over GC and listener thread
   	actions.

--1.69.18--

   !	aclocal.m4, version.h.in.in, LibSnert.c: added configure and compile
   	options to VersionInfo structure.

--1.69.17--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.6.2

   !	aclocal.m4, org/sqlite/makefile: added support for SQLite patch
	files if necessary.

   !	tlds.c; updated 1st and 2nd level tld lists.

   !	mime.h/c: renamed

   		mime_part_start -> mime_body_start
		mime_part_finish -> mime_body_finish
		mime_part_length -> mime_body_length
		mime_part_decode_length -> mime_body_decode_length

	Added a new mime_part_length for overall MIME part length.

   +	mime.h/c: added mime_header_octet hook.

   !	uri.c: Disabled old mime parser in favour of using newer version.
   	Added uriMimeCreate and uriMimeFree.

   !	pdq.c: Added some extra log messages to attempt to identify the
	packet request/response name that causes a "unsupported DNS RR
	type" error.

   !	pdq.c: Added extra info for "pdq_name_copy() out of bounds" error
   	displaying the initial 40 bytes of the data copied into buffer.

   !	pdq.c: fixed pdq_name_skip to detect potential buffer out of
   	bounds condition; previously it could cause undefined result#
   	and/or a seg.fault.

   !	getopt.c/h, flock.c/h: Mac OS X links libc symbols ahead of
	replacement functions. In order to ensure we link with our
	version, we need to use an alternative name.

   !	pthreadSleep: Mac OS X does not have a clock_gettime, even though
   	pthread_cond_timedwait needs an absolute timespec to be specified.
   	Have implemented pthreadSleep using nanosleep or sleep as a fall
   	back.


--1.69.16--

   !	aclocal.m4: SNERT_GCC_SETTINGS remove -s from LDFLAGS in favour of using
   	strip(1) as needed. MAC OS X doesn't support -s.

   +	net/isRFC2606.c, network.h: added IS_TLD_LAN for .lan TLD.

   +	pid.c: added exclusive flock on the pid file that a process
   	maintains to prevent other instances of the application from
   	replacing the pid file before it is ready.

--1.69.15--

   !	mccGetKey: assert that the value_data does not overflow its max.
	size.

   +	aclocal.m4: added check for getloadavg.

   !	processDumpCore: minor changes to support Linux additional settings
   	for core dumps.

--1.69.14--

   !	uri.c: fix handling of cid:, it was being incorrectly treated
	like mailto: Report by Alex Broens.

   !	uri.c: fix implicit matching of email addresses so as not to
	match runs of characters surrounding an at-sign (@) that do not
	actually form an email address. Report by Alex Broens.

   !	uri.c: URL decode the URL before parsing. Some URL in spam URL
   	encode the :// including query strings with email addresses.
   	This ment that the URI was misidentified as an email address
   	instead of HTTP. See uri.txt. Reported by Alex Broens.

   !	uri.c: handle decoding "&lt;", "&gt;", and "&amp;" strings that
   	could be used around and withing a URI.

--1.69.13--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.4

   !	socketReadLine2: add a debug guard around use of TIME_START and
	TIMER_DIFF that might have been causing some CPU load.

   !	socketReadLine2, socketWrite, socketWriteTo: added sleep(1) in
   	the event of EAGAIN to avoid getting into a tight busy-wait-loop.

--1.69.12--

   +	Added util/digestbl.c

   !	mimeNextCh: fixed lazy boundary detection so as to exclude
	matching the "--" mail signature boundary.

   !	mime.c: Major fix of the lazy MIME boundary detection code to
	take into account that the CRLF before the boundary line is part
	of the boundary as per RFC 2046 section 5.1.1. Common Syntax

--1.69.11--

   !	pdqPoll, pdq_wait: added debug guards before TIMER_START calls.

--1.69.10--

   +	Added tools/rarlist.c tool similar to ziplist.

--1.69.9--

   +	tools/taglengths.c: added a stats tools to identify HTML tags and
   	comments, lengths, frequency, total length, average length, and
   	max. length.

--1.69.8--

   !	ziplist.c: modified to read little-endian data stream in a machine
   	neutral manner.

   !	smdb.c/h: Changed value of SMDB_ACCESS_TEMPFAIL. This really shouldn't
   	be here as it is currently only specific to BarricadeMX, which should
   	handle detecting TEMPFAIL or TRAP.

   !	mcc.h: structe mcc_extra renamed to avoid conflicting with the typedef
   	of the same name.

  !!	mcc.c/h: Changed thread stack size used from 2*PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
	to be MCC_STACK_SIZE, which is 32KB by default. FreeBSD 6.2 sets
	PTHREAD_STACK_MIN at 2KB.

--1.69.7--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.3

   +	smdb.c/h: Added TEMPFAIL word.

--1.69.6--

   !	socket2.c: moved socketAddress* functions into a socketAddress.c.

   !	pdq.c: replaced "union socket_address" by SocketAddress. Seems
   	pointless not to take advantage of the socket address API.

   !	options.c: optionUsage added NULL guards concerning o->string.

   +	Added pdqDump and pdqLog for a single record.

   !	pdqListPrune, pdqListFindName, pdqSetName: The handling of
	implicit MX 0 rule was broken. The MX 0 rule that was created
	forgot the root label. Thus pdqListPrune would prune the MX 0
	record, because pdqListFindName failed to find the host name due
	to the missing root label. pdqSetName now asserts that a root
	label is always present and pdqListFindName will match a host
	name with or without the root label.

--1.69.5--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.2

   !	pdq.c: Windows: when there are no DNS servers specified, default
   	to localhost. See pdq_get_name_servers.

   +	pdq.c: added pdqSetSourcePortRandomisation and test option for CLI.
   	Intend for use on systems that might not randomise the source port
   	in the kernel.

   !	aclocal.m4: SNERT_BUILD_THREADED_SQLITE3 now appened --enable-debug
   	when necessary and enforce --disable-amalgamation.

--1.69.4--

   !	spf.c: when --enable-pdq, the handling of ptr entries with a domain
   	specifier failed. For example

   		./spf 194.192.15.188 cplaromas.com

   	with a TXT record "v=spf1 +mx +a:mx11bx.cplaromas.com
	+a:mx12bx.cplaromas.com +mx:cplaromas.com +mx:softcom.dk
	+ptr:softcom.dk -all" should pass. There were two logic errors in
	processing the PTR list loop.

--1.69.3--

   +	Added util/timespec.c with timespec support routines: timespecAdd,
   	timespecSubtract.

   +	Added util/timeval.c with timeval support routines: timevalAdd,
   	timevalSubtract.

   !	util/timer.h: when HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME is defined, then TIMER_DIFF
   	uses timespecSubtract.

   +	util/timer.h: added timer routines for HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY when
   	HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME is not defined.

   !	socketReadLine2: Windows appears to generate a lot more EAGAIN
   	warning messages for non-blocking input than unix systems. Changed
   	the warning log message from counter based to a single second
   	timer. The log message exists to catch unusually long waits for
   	input and to alert to possible infinite loops waiting for input.

  !!	pdqInit: default to localhost when resolv.conf is empty.

   !	optionUsage: change usage output to use += notation for lists.

   !	spfCheck: when --enable-pdq, the handling of A and MX records with
   	dual-cidr specified was incorrectly ported to PDQ. For example

   		./spf 12.32.40.146 thecreek.com

   	with a TXT record of "v=spf1 mx/24 -all" should pass.

--1.69.2--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.6.0

   !	aclocal.m4: added checks for sleep, usleep, and nanosleep.

   !	kvm_open_sql: sqlite3_prepare_v2 can return SQLITE_BUSY when the
	database is locked by another process. This means that
	kvm_open_sql would fail for a temporary condition. Added
	kvm_prepare_sql to keep looping over the sqlite3_prepare_v2 with
	one second pause between retries.

--1.69.1--

  !!	spf.c: when using PDQ API, fixed error handling of the list of
	TXT records returned where some of the answers might set rr->
	rcode to something other than PDQ_RCODE_OK (instead of just the
	first one), which would mean that the text.value field would be
	NULL and cause a seg. fault if accessed.

--1.69.0--

   !	Build id reset to zero.

   +	socket2.c/h: addedd socketAddressEqual.

   !	pdq.c; pdq_query_reply now validates that the PDQ response comes
	from a previously queried name server. This was added based on
	http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsext-forgery-resilience-05
	section 3.

   -	pdq.c: removed ENABLE_PDQ_FD_PER_NS code.

  !!	pdq.c: fixed pdq_query_fill when performing a query for "." or a
	domain name starting with a leading dot, eg. ".snert.com". An
	extra root label was inadvertantly added to the query,
	displacing the remain fields by one byte, which would cause a
	timeout, which in turn caused pdq_reply_rr to fail to generate
	an "error" RR and ultimately result in a seg. fault when trying
	to set the record->code to PDQ_RCODE_TIMEDOUT.

   |	pdq.c: In the event of a time out in pdq_query_send_all and in
   	case pdq_reply_rr should return NULL do to out of memory or an
   	unknown RR type, only set the error code if the record is not
   	NULL to avoid potential seg. faults in the future.

--1.68.972--

   +	pdq.c: Added support for RFC 2672 DNAME type.

   !	pdqSizeOfType: unknown DNS type return 0 size.

   !	pdq_reply_parse: fixed handling of unknown records types that
   	would case pdq_reply_rr to return NULL. Unknown RR types are
   	now skipped instead of discarding all the returned RR parsed.

  !!	kvmap.c: fixed -d crashing when the value is an empty string.
  	Also skip the record if the key is an empty string.

   !	pdqFree now expressed in terms of pdqDestroy, which frees a
	single PDQ_rr record.

   !	spf.c: fixed CLI when --enable-pdq, setups pdqInit and pdqFini
   	instead of relying pdqOpen doing a pdqInit behind the scenes.

   !	spf.c: when --enable-pdq and processing the mx mechanism, the
	convience function pdqGetMX could return NULL after pruning,
	which is not an indication of an internal error if errno is
	zero.

   !	pdq.c: Added -p option for the CLI to test pdqListPrune code.

  !!	pdqListPrune: Fixed memory leak when discarding invalid A/AAAA
  	records. The loop would skip over non-A/AAAA records, but failed
  	to update the "prev" pointer that remembers the address of the
  	previous record's next field. This affected pdqGetMx, spfCheck,
  	and any where that pdqListPrune was used after a MX, NS, or SOA
  	lookup.

   !	isReservedTLD: improve performance by finding the last dot in a
	domain name then comparing the tail end of the domain for
	reserved names, instead of use TextInsensitiveEndWith
	repeatedly.

   +	Add -g option for mcc CLI to start a GC on a specified interval.

   !	mccStartUnicast: set the unicast socket to non-blocking.

   !	socketOpen: fix opening a unix domain socket.

   !	pdq_txt_create, pdqDestroy: when the overall length and the
	accumenlate TXT string length mismatch, we freed the value
	field, but neglected to set it to NULL, which caused a double
	free in pdqDestroy.

   !	PDQ API is now enabled by default.


--1.68.971--

   +	Added fileSetCloseOnExec to perfer a read-modify-write operation
   	when setting FD_CLOEXEC as there might be other flags in future.
   	Based on SUS rationale for fcntl.

   !	uri.c, option.c, smtp2.c: replaced fcntl with fileSetCloseOnExec.

   +	Added util/timer.h for time difference logging.

--1.68.970--

   !	socketAddressGetIPv6: added extra flags parameter that for
	assorted conversions. Currently only SOCKET_ADDRESS_AS_IPV4 is
	supported to normalise IPv4-mapped to IPv4-compatible address.
	Particularly useful when you want to compare IPv4 addresses
	returned by an IPv6 network stack.

--1.68.969--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.5.9

   !	ProcTitle: undo previous ProcTitleInit change that freed environ.
   	causes a glibc abort in free.

   !	aclocal.m4: SNERT_PTHREAD added check for pthread_attr_getscope
   	and pthread_attr_setscope

   !	mccStartUnicast, mccStartMulticast, mccStartGc: apply thread
	attributes to set stack size (PTHREAD_STACK_MIN) and scope
	(PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM).

   !	mcc.c: Removed from mccSetMulticastTTL the test if the multicast
   	listener is running as there is a race condition between starting
   	the mcc_listener_thread, which sets the is_running flag, and the
   	initialisation thread that starts the listner and then calls
   	mccSetMulticastTTL to setup the socket. socketMulticastTTL already
   	checks for a NULL socket pointer before applying the setting.

   !	processDumpCore: silence Linux valgrind errors concerning
	missing prctl arguments.

   !	optionsArray: fix small memory leak when an unknown option is not
   	found in the option table, then value from optionParse should be
   	freed. This is not serious since the option parsing typically is
   	called at program start-up.

  !!	pdqGetDnsList: when doing DNS BL lookups and returning on the
	first positive answer (pdqWait), then undefined answers
	(NXDOMAIN) would cause a memory leak, because of using free
	instead of pdqFree to discard the PDQ_RCODE_UNDEFINED record.
	Have corrected, but disabled this code. PDQ_RCODE_UNDEFINED
	records are now returned.

  !!	pdqGetDnsList: when querying two or more DNS BL lists and using
  	pdqWait, if there were still pending answers, then the partial
  	answers were not accumulated in a list each iteration thus
  	causing a memory leak.

  !!	pdqGet: if a query for an MX returns PDQ_RCODE_UNDEFINED record,
  	then the implicit MX 0 record was created, without having freed
  	the PDQ_RCODE_UNDEFINED record thus causing a memory leak.

  !!	spfCheck: if a query for a TXT returns PDQ_RCODE_UNDEFINED record,
  	then a memory leak would occur.

--1.68.968--

   +	TextFind: extended to support character class matches.

		"a[]]c"		exact match for "a]c"

		"[abc]"		match a single "a", "b", or "c".

		"[^abc]"	match a single charcater except "a", "b", or "c".

		"[a-z]"		match a single character "a" through "z" (assumes ASCII)

		"[0-9]"		match a single digit "0" through "9" (assumes ASCII)

		"[-ac]"		match a single charcater "-", "a", or "c".

		"[]-ac]		match a single charcater "]", "-", "a", or "c".

		"[^-ac]"	match a single charcater except "-", "a", or "c".

		"[^]-ac]	match a single charcater execpt "]", "-", "a", or "c".

	This is similar to filename pattern matching and not to be
	confused with regex.

   !	pdqGetDnsList: fixed potential error for access off either end of
   	the prefix name buffer. Reported by valgrind.

   !	socketTimeouts: when using poll, we can get a small performance
	gain for small sets by allocating a fixed number of struct
	pollfd on the stack instead of using malloc/free. This would
	improve socketHasInput, socketCanSend, and socketTimeoutIO which
	only handle a single socket at a time via socketTimeouts.

   !	socketTimeouts: fixed potential bug when using poll. Previously
	the fd_table could potentialy contain INVALID_SOCKET entries,
	which were skipped when filling in the set of struct pollfd.
	However, the post poll code that would fill in fd_ready based on
	the results assumed that poll set was of equal length to
	fd_table and fd_ready; if "set" were ever shorter, undefined
	results would be returned. This bug never appeared that I know
	of since only valid sockets were ever passed. The solution was
	to make it a requirement that fd_table not contain
	INVALID_SOCKET entries otherwise we return false and set errno
	to EINVAL.

   +	time62.c/h: moved these functions from BarricadeMX into library
	for use by other titles, eg. Hibachi and milter-null.

   !	spfCheck: simplified handling of pdqFree following pdq lookup.

   +	pdq.c: added pdqInitialTimeout function.

   !	ProcTitle: on linux, glibc will free environ. No need to do it
   	ourselves in ProcFini.

   !	aclocal.m4: Fix SNERT_PTHREAD to detect pthread_cleanup_push/pop
	when defined as macros.

--1.68.967--

   !	aclocal.m4, configure.in: merged SNERT_NETWORK and SNERT_SOCKET into one.

   !	SNERT_NETWORK for Windows now detects sockaddr types and sa_len member
   	in order to correctly build IPv6 support.

   !	mcc.c/h: Added mccSetMulticastTTL to allow for finer control over
   	multicast packets.

   +	tools/echod.c: add a simple echo daemon for testing IPv4 & IPv6 socket
   	code.

   !	socketAddressCreate: changed malloc to calloc for the
	SocketAddress structure in order to ensure a clear and sane
	state. On Windows, failure to do this meant that IPv6 addresses
	wouldn't bind due to garbage in the sockaddr_in6 structure.

--1.68.966--

   !	parsePath; split STRICT_SYNTAX into two STRICT_ANGLE_BRACKETS
	and STRICT_ADDR_SPEC.

   !	parsePath: the address <Vanessa-kauskas:@SELSOL.COM> is bad
	(colon is reserved for soure route addresses), but was returning
	"address incomplete" instead of "invalid local part", which is
	the more correct error.

   !	smdb.c: reduceDomain when called from reduceMail was not advancing
   	the tag such that the last lookup "tag:user.name@" was not being
   	performed.

   !	pdq.c, formatIP.c: failed to properly format ::1. Also RFC 4291
	indicates that :: can represent one or more groups of zero bits,
	whereas previously is was understood / assumed to be two or more
	groups. While "::" equals "::0" and "fe80::" equals "fe80::0",
	the latter forms are more expressive and used.

   !	aclocal.m4, version.h.in.in: SNERT_NETWORK macro now checks for
   	getaddrinfo, freeaddrinfo, and getnameinfo.

   +	socket2.c/h: socketAddressGetName to convert a socket address back
   	into a host name or it's IP address. Use PDQ, getaddrinfo, or
   	gethostbyaddr. PDQ is default since it is thread safe.

   !	socketAddressGetString: replace with_port boolean flag with a set
	of flag bits SOCKET_ADDRESS_WITH_PORT, SOCKET_ADDRESS_WITH_BRACKETS,
	SOCKET_ADDRESS_AS_FULL, SOCKET_ADDRESS_AS_IPV4

   +	format.c, socket2.h: Added socketAddressFormatIp that can format
   	socketaddr (sockaddr_in, sockaddr_in6, and sockaddr_un) into a
   	buffer.

   +	sys/sys.c: added sysGetCpuCount, sysGetCpuOnline, getSysCtlInt, and
   	getSysCtlString. The CPU query functions should work for Linux,
   	*BSD, Windows, and some other systems that can report number of
   	processors via sysconf. The getSysCtl* functions are only on
   	OpenBSD for now and may change or be moved.

   !	formatIP: IPv4-compatible-IPv6 and IPv4-mapped-IPv6 are represented
   	as RFC 4291 section 2.2 point 3 hybrid IPv6/IPv4 notation. This is
   	more convenient and familar for use in logs and displays.

   !	socketAddressFormatIp: must ignore other protocol/address familys.
   	Only supports AF_INET, AF_INET6, and AF_UN. In particualr AF_IPX
   	on Windows must fail (return 0).

--1.68.965--

   +	pdq.c: added pdqSetRoundRobin and modified pdq_query_send to
	query NS one at a time in round robin order if pdq_round_robin
	is set. This is was implemented in case querying all the NS at
	once causes too much load on NS machines.

--1.68.964--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.5.7

   !	pdq.c: wrapped existing code with ENABLE_PDQ_FD_PER_NS, which is
   	rather resource intensive and implement one FD per pdq structure.
   	FreeBSD 4 jails are problematic and require --enable-pdq-fd-per-ns.

   !	pdq now parses and returns all the records given by a lookup so
   	that it is easier to distinguish between an error and a valid
   	domain without records of a requested type.

   !	sqlargs.c: SunOS cc defines __unix, but not __unix__. Version.h
	handle defining __unix__ if __unix, but this header was included
	after the configuration section. Reported by Rob McMahon.

   !	pdq.c now defines rand_seed and set srand accordingly for use with
   	rand_r when available.

   !	networkGetMyName, networkGetHostIp: added some error logging; moved
   	into new file networkGetMyDetails.c.

   !	pthread_join emulation in Windows failed to handle a NULL 2nd
   	argument.

   !	LogPrintV: switched from using gmtime to localtime_r.

   !	LogPrintV: now uses flockfile / funlockfile or a mutex to ensure
	output to the log file from multiple threads is safe.

   !	uri.c: added ENABLE_PDQ switch and code.

   !	tools/show.c: when using -f and -n -num, fflush the tail output
   	before processing -f.

   !	LogPrintV: increased log line buffer to 512 bytes.

   !	mccStartMulticast: I was binding to the multicast address, which
	worked on unix for some reason, but not on Windows. Now I bind
	to INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0 or ::0) and the multicast port for the
	listener thread, then join the multicast address/port for the
	broadcast.

   +	socket2.c/h: added socketMulticastLoopback and socketMulticastTTL.

   +	mccStartMulticast: now disables the multicast loopback.

   !	socket.c/h: Added ERRNO_EQ_EAGAIN macro to finally deal with possible
   	instances both EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK being defined and not equal to
   	each other.

   !	smtp2.c: Added a new internal flag SMTP_FLAG_ERROR for IO errors.
   	Used by mxPrint and mxResponse in order to skip further IO on duff
   	session.

   !	smtp2.c: smtp2Open, smtp2OpenMx, mailOpen all replace debug
	argument with a flags argument. Added a new public flag
	SMTP_FLAG_TRY_ALL for mailOpen to indicate whether the message
	should continue to be sent even if there are partial errors (ie.
	some sessions reject/fail) or fail on any errors. This allows
	messages sent to more than one recipient to continue to be sent
	even if some recipients fail.

   !	smtp2.c; Added new -a option to smtp2 CLI to set SMTP_FLAG_TRY_ALL.

   !	smtp2.c: smtp2Open, smtp2OpenMx, mailOpen now support two timeout
   	arguments: one for connection, the other for SMTP commands.

--1.68--

   !	mime.h; MIME_BUFFER_SIZE reduced from 2048 to 1024.

   !	smdbMailMail: fixed bug for from:domain:to:mail lookups not being
   	found.

   !	pdq.c reworked without an internal cache. Changed the pdqPoll,
	pdqWait, and pdqWaitAll API. Added several pdqList* functions
	Also add pdqGetDnsList and pdqFetchDnsList functions to simplify
	querying DNS based lists. Fixed glitch in pdqListRemove. Simplified
	pdqGet and pdqGet5A.

   +	pdq.c: added support for DNS NULL, HINFO, and MINFO RR types.

   !	uriParse2: fixed bug with decoding URI that are URL encoded.

   !	uriIsDomainBL, uriIsHostBL moved into a separate file in preparation
   	to replace the old Dns API with the new PDQ API.

   !	optionUsage: minor change to skip writing option name settings when
   	the option name starts with a non-printable character.

   +	configure.in, version.h.in.in: added a compile time option --enable-pdq
   	in order to select which DNS client API to use in some functions.

   !	socket2.c, siq.c, smtp2.c, spf.c: added ENABLE_PDQ switch and code.

   !	mcc.c: mccStartUnicastDomain disabled when using ENABLE_PDQ; too lazy
   	to port and it's more confusing to use that mccStartUnicast, should
   	go away.

   !	uriParse2: When handling an "Invalid or unknown scheme followed by ://"
   	make sure we don't test beyond the start of the URI string, which
   	could cause a seg. fault for some systems.

   !	tlds.c: tldInit now an external function. tldInit must be explicitly
   	called in order to load tld files, otherwise the default internal
   	tables are used.

   !	ipinclient.c: fixed find_substr which was matching.

		Only ignore punctuation in the string. Do NOT ignore
		non-hex alpha in the string. Consider

		193.190.238.226	smtp-out.west-vlaanderen.be

		Bytes 2 & 1 (eebe) would incorrectly match the substring
		"eren.be", ignoring the 'r' and 'n' in the string.

   !	ipinclient.c: fixed find_octets what was mismatching

		83.98.0.245 	intthsv06.thuk.ioko365.com

	on the 16-bit octal word tests.

   !	formatIP: fixed IPv6 bug when formatting an IP address with an
   	odd number of leading zeros like ::1.

   !	pdqOpen: fixed crash when pdqOpen fails and proceeds to pdqClose
   	a PDQ structure that was not completely initialised.

   !	pthread_join, pthread_cancel, pthread_detach: fix potential
	Windows thread handle leaks.
	***
	NOTE avoid the idiom

		pthread_detach(pthread_self);

	and instead have the caller of pthread_create do pthread_detach
	or pthread_join so as to avoid HANDLE leaks.
	***

   !	mcc.c: mcc_sql_create can now detect if the table and/or index have
   	already been defined, thus avoid unnecessary log messages.

--1.67--

   !    Upgraded SQLite to 3.5.6

   !	aclocal.m4: Fixed missing LDFLAGS when using --enable-mingw.

   !	sys/pthread.c: pthread_exit using ExitThread; not 100% correct.

   !	sys/pthread.c: disabled pthread_cancel, MSDN state that use of
   	TerminateThread is unsafe and that the developer should implement
   	their own cancellation code if UNIX semantics are required.

   !	version.h.in.in, sys/pthread.h: moved Win32 HAVE_PTHREAD_
	definitions from version.h to sys/pthread.h.

   !	socketTimeoutIO.c: added FD_ZERO() in socket_reset_set() to
   	prevent Windows build from seg. faulting.

   !	uriHttpOrigin(): fixed handling of redirects that required query
   	string arguments, without which an infinite loop could result.
   	(milter-link, BarricadeMX)

   !	aclocal.m4, version.sh.in, */makefile.in: added conditional
   	inclusion of -lws2_32 when --enable-mingw.

   !	pthread.c: pthread_mutex_timeout_lock(), used in WIN32
	emulation, failed to wait for the given timeout period.

   !	uriParse2(): fixed invalid parsing of tokens starting with a
   	leading at-sign (@) like: @font-face @SimSun @page. (milter-link,
   	BarricadeMX)

   !	smtp2.c: fixed potential memory leak between smtp2Read() and
   	mxResponse().

   !	aclocal.m4: added BDB 4.6 to list of versions to search for.

   +	Added Martin Pool's strnatcmp.c code, with ANSI C portability
	changes, to the library. License updated to reflect original
	source.

   +	pdq.c: further changes and additions to the PDQ API.

   !	Dns.c, pdq.c, uri.c, siq.c, smtp2.c, options.c: make sure that
	open file descriptors are automatically closed on fork/exec.

   !	pthread.c, pthreadSleep.c: moved pthreadMutexDestroy() to pthread.c

   +	kvm.c: add pthread_atfork handlers.

   !	uriParse2(): implicit_domain_min_dots was been correctly handled
   	but subsequently discarded, because a default scheme was not set.
   	When an implied host name is found, assume HTTP scheme.

   !	mcc.c: rename mcc_sql_step() to be a public function mccSqlStep().

   !	tlds.c: Added the ability to replace the built-in TLD lists from
   	supplied text file.

   +	ipinclient.c: Added additional check for when high or low halfs
	of an IPv4 address is expressed as 16-bit decimal, octet, or hex
	words. For example dsl88-244-35467.ttnet.net.tr should match
	[88.224.138.139].

   !	uri.c: Changed uriParse2() trace output at debug level 4, because
   	when doing MIME parsing, the uriParse2 is called far too much to
   	follow the lower debug levels.

   !	uriParse2: incorrectly parsed Microsoft Office smart tags:

	   <o:SmartTagType =
	   namespaceuri=3D"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"
	    name=3D"Street" =
	   downloadurl=3D"http://www.5iantlavalampft-com:office:smarttags"/>

	The neither namespaceuri nor downloadurl attributes should
	parse. Note how they resemble SOME.DOMAIN-NAME:PORT, but should
	not parse because the PORT is not numeric.

   !	sys/Time.c: replaced the TIME_API selector in favour of the autoconf
   	detected functions.

   !	mcc.c: added a call-back structure that can provide ways for third
   	party code to added custom functions and statements that operate on
   	the cache. See BarricadeMX grey.c.

   !	socket2.c: renamed socketPeek to socketPeekByte and added a new
   	socketPeek function similar to socketRead that fills a buffer
   	without draining the input.

   !	Buf.c: overhauled to use Buf * and size_t for offset and length.
	BufAddInputLine and BufAddReadLine retain the newline character
	at the end of the buffer. Added BufTrim to remove trailing white
	space.

   !	option.c, option.h: added a length field to the Option structure.

   !	uriParse2: now parses implicit IPv4 and IPV6 addresses.

   !	uri.c: now find the IP in the query part of URL like:

   	http://www.zdnetasia.com/search/results.htm?query=mari+misato+at+dynamix+%3CIFRAME%20src=//72.232.39.252/a/%3E.html

   !	spanIP.c, uri.c: moved spanIP, spanIPv4, spanIPv6 into a separate
   	source file as they are generally useful.

   +	findIP.c: created new functions findIPv4, findIPv6, and findIP to
   	scan through a string looking for the first IP contained there in.

   !	mccStartUnicast: in the event of socket setup error, the function
   	incorrectly called mccStopMulticast, instead of mccStopUnicast.

   !	mcc: exit if -M and/or -U listener threads cannot be started.

   !	uri.c: turned on #define TEST_MESSAGE_PARTS to enable message/rfc822
   	scanning. I had concerns that scanning message/rfc822 might prove
   	a problem for both bounce and forwarded messages, but I won't know
   	until I turn it on.

   !	pdq.c: nameCopy now returns the length of the string copied into
   	the buffer. This removed the need for nameLength.

   !	pdq.c: pdq_query_parse failed to assign the IP address string
	length and for A records failed to place the binary IPv4
	adderss to the right of the IPv6 sized buffer.

   !	mime.c: fixed bug where spammers send quoted printable mail as a
	single continuous line, exceeding RFC 2821 line limits. If a
	quoted printable character sequence "straddles across" the
	buffer end, ie. "=X" are the last things in the buffer and the
	state is mimeStateQpDecode, then we have to "carry over" the
	information related to that state as part of the buffer reset.

--1.66.951--

  !!	smdb.c: fixed off-by-one error in reduceDomain which could cause
	a segmentation fault. This only occurs when looking up keys with
	no tag.

--1.66.950--

   !	tools/sqlargs: Windows native version.

   !	kvm.c: Solaris 9 does not define the flock() constants in the
   	usual place it seems. Added #include <com/snert/lib/io/file.h>

--1.66--

   !	Upgraded SQLite to 3.5.3

   !	smdb.c: rewritten and enhanced to support combined tag lookups.

   !	smdbMailMail() was calling singleKey instead of singleKeyGetCode
   	and returning 0 or -1 result instead of an SMDB_ACCESS_* result,
   	which breaks combo tag handling in BarricadeMX.

   !	mcc.c: mcc_listener_thread() make sure old_row.key_data is NUL
	byte terminate when writing syslog lines to avoid displaying
	undefined / unrelated data that could be confused as corruption.

   +	mcc: Added mccSetIfCorrupt() for debugging. Allows an application
   	to bail or retain a corrupted cache database instead of replacing
   	it automatically.

   +	mcc: Added mccSetSync() to adjust synchronisation behaviour.

   !	mcc, kvm: Changed to use recommended sqlite_prepare_v2() API.
   	mcc_sql_step / kvm_sql_step changed accordingly.

   !	mcc, kvm: Based on SQLite wiki comments, a sqlite_reset() is
	called by mcc_sql_step / kvm_sql_step for everything except
	SQLITE_ROW return, assuring that the statement's state machine
	is reset for the next call.

   !	mcc: mcc_sql_step() use pthreadSleep() when available.

   !	convertDate() family of functions now ignore RFC 2822 header
   	comments that might appear in the date/time string.

   !	convertDate() family of functions now take a 3rd parameter that
   	returns a pointer to the next unread character in the string.

   !	smdbOpen() had an off-by-one bug when an map file type was
	specified without a leading table name. Affects Snert milters
	and smtpf. Reported by Cristian Merz.

   !	aclocal.m4: SNERT_BUILD_THREADED_SQLITE3: fixed passing of
	extra CFLAGS/LDFLAGS, especially when --enable-64bit is
	specified.

   !	mime.c, smdb.c: added casts to resolve 64-bit signedess warnings

   !	SNERT_OPTION_ENABLE_DEBUG specifies -O0 when debug is enabled.

   !	smdb.c: fixed logging of key/value lookups.

   !	uri.h, uri.c: rename the "struct mime" to "struct mime_uri_parse"
   	as it conflicts with mail/mime.h. Also rename mimeReset to
   	mimePartReset.

   !	smfAccessPattern(): make regex pattern matching case insensitive.

   +	process.[ch]: Migrated from smtpf / hibachi some common code:
   	processDropPrivelages(), processDumpCore().

   +	processDumpCore() now supports FreeBSD kern.sugid_coredump.

   !	processDumpCore() allows for OpenBSD kern.nosuidcoredump=2 to
   	be set.

   !	uri.c: modified uriParse2() to attempt to find a possible URI
   	when the scheme might be invalid or unknown, but is followed by
   	an identifiable "://" used in a URI. Reported by Jim Hermann.
	This should allow a URI prefixed by multibyte character
	sequences to be found, for example:

   		$B%Q%=%3%s!&7HBS!!(Bhttp://www.c-evian.com

   !	uri.c: fixed command line tool to find URI at the end of a file
   	that does not end with a newline.

   !	uri.c: fixed mimeGetUri() to decode HTML numerical entities that
   	are used to obfuscate URL domains.

   !	smdb.: singleKey() fixed joining of tag and key into a new string
   	which Valgrind reported as "Conditional jump or move depends on
   	uninitialised value" line 210. Fixed a second instance of similar
   	string construction line 246.

   !	mccDestroy(): fixed potential memory leak of mcc->secret.

   !	mccCreate(): fix potential seg. fault; assert that a empty secret
   	is defined, otherwise mcc_send() could seg. fault.

   !	b64.c: b64Encode(), b64EncodeFinish() changed behaviour of
	marking the end-of-data of an encoding ending on a full
	quantum by "====" into a parameter. Normally this should be
	ignored by well implemented decoders, except sendmail doesn't
	seem to handle this case well when used in AUTH PLAIN.

   	The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6 IEEE Std 1003.1,
	2004 Edition uuencode -m supports the use of "====" to denote
	end-of-data.

	And from RFC 2045 section 6.8 Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding
	states:

	    Because it [equals-sign] is used only for padding at the
	    end of the data, the occurrence of any "=" characters may
	    be taken as evidence that the end of the data has been
	    reached (without truncation in transit).  No such
	    assurance is possible, however, when the number of octets
	    transmitted was a multiple of three and no "=" characters
	    are present.

	    Any characters outside of the base64 alphabet are to be
	    ignored in base64-encoded data.

   !	isIPv4InClientName(): adjusted heuristic when looking for
	least significant octet of IP address; make sure to check for
	two consecutive hex digits to avoid false positives for
	something like: dns3.nettica.com 64.94.136.13

   !	isIPv4InClientName(): fixed bug which incorrectly identified
   	ns1.ipandmore.de [213.252.1.1] or any case of *.1.1 in a string
   	containing only a single digit 1.

   +	io/file.[ch]: moved chownByName() and chmodByName() convience
   	functions into a single function pathSetPermsByName() and added
   	similar functions. io/file.h will eventually replace io/posix.h.

   !	version.h.in.in: moved flock() constants and definition into
   	io/file.h.

   +	Added socketTimeouts() to handle multiple file descriptors.

   !	socketTimeoutIO() changed to use socketTimeouts().

   !	Dns.c: moved string reversal functions into net/reverse.c.

   +	pdq.c: Added new "Posted Domain Query" as a new replacement
   	asynchronous DNS client that supports TCP queries too.

   +	smtp2.[ch]: Yet another SMTP engine API to use in place of the
	previous incarnations. Not backwards compatible. This version
	actually has a two APIs that makes a distinction between two
	operational layers: SMTP connection (multiple recipients for
	the same destination) and sending mail directly (multiple
	recipients to multiple destinations). It will also make sure
	that RFC 2822 required headers are sent if not otherwise
	specified.

   -	tools/smtpout.c dropped in favour or smtp2 CLI.

   !	uri.c, mime.c: mimiGetUri() now handles a line of hyphens that
	end with a quoted-printable soft line break, for example:

   		----------------------------------------=\n
   		-------\n

   	Prior to this, the first line would be misinterpreted as a
	MIME boundary. (In mime.c it was two boundaries.)

   !	uri: Fixed CLI to better detect mail messages (ie. leading
   	headers) vs. a text file when parsing for URI.

   !	Cache.c: fixed double call to db_create().

   !	smdb.c: singleKey() would return not found if tag1 is NULL,
	however there are times we do want to lookup a value without a
	tag. So now if tag1 is NULL, then set it to the empty string.

   !	smdb.c: doubleKey(), like singleKey() can accept NULL for both
   	tag1 and tag2, in which case tag1 default to an empty string
   	and tag2 to ":".

   !	smdb.c: singleKey(), doubleKey(), smdbGetValue() add database
	handle NULL guard; milter-ahead by default does not open
	access.db, but still makes the function calls relying on the
	functions to return SMDB_ACCESS_NOT_FOUND.

   +	Added isIPv4InName() which can take optional TextMatch B/W
	pattern lists. Reimplemented isIPv4InClientName() in terms of
	isIPv4InName().

   +	Added tools/sqlargs.c CLI. Commissioned by Alex Broens.

	usage:  sqlargs [-c command_template][-d delim][-m max] db_url
			[select_statement]

	An xargs(1) like command-line tool that queries a data source
	for arguments to be used in a command substitution. Each row
	from the data source will invoke one instance of the command
	(default is to echo the row to standard output), with a limit
	as to how many instances of the command may be running at a
	time.

	-c command_template
		A shell command line, where $1 through $n are replaced
		by the corresponding columns specified. This command is
		passed to /bin/sh using the -c flag; interpretation, if
		any, is performed by the shell. The default is similar
		to ''echo "$@"''

	-d delim
		The column delimiter used to split CSV file.

	-m max
		The maximum number of commands, specified by -c, that
		can be on going at any one time. The default is one (1).

	db_url
		Use one of the following formats:

			csv:/path/to/file.txt
			sqlite:/path/to/db.sq3

	select_statement
		The select statement to invoke on the data source. The
		order of columns returned will be the order used for
		positional parameters used for substitution in the
		command template string. This argument is ignored for
		csv:

   !	tools/popin.c: changed to leave the end-of-message dot from
	the pop sever in the output. This allows other tools in a pipe
	to detect where one message ends and the next begins, eg.
	smtp2

   +	tools/popin,c: added -u (UIDL) and -s (STAT) options. STAT was
	always the default command when no option was present, but it
	wasn't possible to invoke STAT along with other options at the
	same time.

   +	tools/popin.c: added APOP login support for when it detects
   	a banner token between angle brackets, it use APOP in place
   	of USER/PASS commands.

   !	tools/popin.c: fixed minor logging bug that failed to print
   	the user login name in the login and logout lines.

   !	tools/popin.c: with -v -v logging goes to standard error
	instead of the maillog (similar to smtp2.c -v -v logging
	behaviour).

   !	options.c: allow option names to start with underscore. Will
   	probably be used to denote experimental options.

   +	tools/mimepart.c: added -d option to support maildir message
	files when used in conjunction with -f. Requested by Alex
	Broens.

   !	uri.c: fixed quoted-printable bug where =20 at the end of a
   	URI, ie. http://oxakeysu.com=20 would incorrectly append the
   	space to the decode buffer, instead of removing it.

   !	Updated for native Windows builds with MINGW: pidKill() (stubbed),
   	pthreadSleep() (use Sleep()), Properties.c (flock emu)

   !	configure.in: add -I/usr/include/w32api to --enable-mingw CFLAGS

   !	mail/mime.c: mimeStateHeader() added buffer underflow guard to
   	avoid reading before the start of the mime source buffer.

--1.65--

   +	mcc.c: Added mccStartUnicastDomain() and -d option to mimic
   	smtpf's cache-unicast-domain for testing and maintenance.

   +	network.h: Added some commonly used flag sets for isReserved
	family of functions: IS_IP_RESTRICTED, IS_IP_LAN, IS_IP_LOCAL.

   !	mcc: Added volatile keyword to is_running flag to avoid it
   	being optimised into a register. Add lots more debug log
   	tracing information when -v set.

   !	mcc: Added pthread_yield() statement before main input loop
   	in order to ensure the listener and gc threads are started.
   	Without this, input can be read and EOF seen before the
   	other threads are ready, resulting in undefined behaviour.

   !	kvm.c, mcc.c: Changed how table creation is handled. Some
   	applications might create the .sq3 file, but not the tables,
   	in which case the API needs to detect the missing tables
   	and create them if necessary. The old method was based on
   	file existence. This also allows mcc and kvm tables to
   	exist in the same file (though this has not been tested).

   !	kvm.c, mcc.c: Corrections for gcc version 4.1.0 20060304 and 64-
	bit CPU, which is rather pedantic about char * vs unsigned char
	* issues.

   +	aclocal.m4, configure.in: added checks for rand_r() and SUS
   	spec for random() et al.

   !	aclocal.m4: fix search for clock_gettime() library under Linux.

   !	mcc: Added "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF" to improve performance at
	the sake of reliability. Since we're a cache, if it becomes
	corrupt, chuck it and start again.

   !	mcc: SQLITE_CANTOPEN is also treated same as SQLITE_CORRUPT.

   !	option.c: replaced optionGet() with optionParse(), which has a
   	simplified function signature.

   !	aclocal.m4: fixed to build SQLite3 for FreeBSD 4 systems.

   !	LogClose(): added NULL pointer guard for logFile.

   !	Windows native (mingw) corrections for kvm, mcc. Add emulation
   	for pthread_mutex_trylock(), pthread_join(), pthread_cancel(),
   	kill().

   !	version.h.in.in, mcc: fixes for exact int types required when
   	moving between 64-bit and 32-bit machines, particularly when
   	mapping UDP packets.

   +	aclocal.m4, makefile.in: added distclean for libsnert's copy of
	sqlite3.

   +	tlds.c: indexValidTLD() must treat a domain that is the
	empty string as an error for the same reasons when it is a
	NULL domain string pointer. The function only makes sense if
	you have defined non-empty string to scan. Affects most
	milters when using unqualified addressess. Reported by
	Christopher Lindsey.

   !	If setproctitle() exists, use it instead; otherwise fall back
   	onto the old methods. Added a quick ProcTitle test tool.

   !	socketAccept() tracing now reports the errno value as part of the
   	log line.

   !	socketReadLine2(), smtpRead(): Changed errno returned for an EOF
	state from ESHUTDOWN to ENOTCONN. The former pertains to writing
	data after close, while the latter better describes the lost
	connection. This also means that use of strerror() for read
	error will make more sense.

   +	Added pthreadSleep() to sleep a thread, not the process, using
   	pthread_cond_timedwait(). sleep() typically pauses the whole
   	process.

   +	Added md4.c and md4.h from RFC 1320.

   +	aclocal.m4: added SNERT_FIND_LIB as a generic function to find
   	which dynamic libraries a binary is linked with. Modified
   	SNERT_FIND_LIBC to use and added SNERT_FIND_LIBPTHREAD.

   +	DebugMalloc.c: enhanced to report leaked memory at the end of
   	each thread. Replaced some environment variables used to
   	control behaviour.

   +	Added ProcTitleFini() to cleanup any allocated structures (Linux).

   !	uri.c:729: changed from memcpy() to memmove() to silence
	valgrind report about copying an overlapping memory region,
	where the dst is explicitly one less than the src, which is not
	a problem for memcpy if you assume left-to-right copying.

   !	mcc.c:804: added guard to skip memcpy() when dst equals src to
	silence valgrind report about copying an overlapping memory
	region.

   +	b64.c: added b64Encode() to encode character by character in
   	quantum units. Also added a CLI test mode.

   + 	mime.c: added a generic on-the-fly MIME parsing API.

   !	Upgraded SQLite to 3.4.1

   +	spf.c: Added option spf-temp-error-dns that can disable DNS
   	lookup errors that would result in a TempError in order to
   	allow the remainder of the record to be parsed and processed.

   +	spf.c: When looking up a TXT record, treat a DNS server failure
	(rcode 2) the same as undefined (rcode 3) and return a None
	result. Too many DNS servers appear to be misconfigured or
	broken such that they return A, MX, and PTR records, but return
	ServFail for TXT.

   +	uri: Added a -P port selector option to filter output. Requested
   	by Alex Broens.

   +	tools/ixhash.c: added a C based ixhash generator tool. Requested
   	by Alex Broens.

   +	aclocal.m4, version.h.in.in: add check for pthread_atfork().

   !	kvm.c: kvm_sql_step() uses pthreadSleep() when compiled with
   	pthread support.

   !	mcc.c: Linux: mccDestroy() moved syslog() trace line after NULL
	pointer guard in an effort to avoid hanging on tzset_lock mutex
	in libc called by strftime() from syslog(). This can happen if
	the mutex is locked when either signal or thread context switch
	occurs and the new context calls syslog().

   !	two-level-tlds.txt and two-level-tlds.txt updated.

--1.64--

   +	tlds.c: indexValidNthTLD() must treat a domain that is the
	empty string as an error for the same reasons when it is a
	NULL domain string pointer. The function only makes sense if
	you have defined non-empty string to scan. Affects most
	milters when using unqualified addressess. Reported by
	Christopher Lindsey.

   !	smfAccessHost(), smfAccessMail(), smfAccessRcpt(): Disabled
	support for sendmail's untaggedd access.db entries. These have
	been deprecated by sendmail and should no longer be used. This
	reduces the access.db lookups for a slight performance gain.
	Use --enable-sendmail-tagless-records to enable at compile time.

   +	Added smdb-relay-ok option. When enabled, a right hand side
   	access.db value of RELAY will be treated the same as a white
   	list OK value, which is technical correct according to the
   	sendmail definition. However, some sites want to "filter before
   	relay" and so do not want to treat RELAY as a white list entry.

   !	mccCreate(): reset the database if SQLITE_CORRUPT error is
   	returned. There is no way to recover other than discarding the
   	old databsae and starting a new.

   !	LICENSE.TXT updated to expressly exclude SQLite from the
	statement of original work.

   !	kvm.c: The kvmd -p option now support unix domain socket path.

   !	kvm.c: Disable SIGPIPE handler.

  !!	kvm.c: Fixed kvmd code for sendmail queries.

   +	socket2.c: Added socketHasBufferedInput() and socketPeek().

   +	socketAddressCreate() supports IP addresses within square
   	brackets in order to support [IPv6]:port specifiers. For
   	consistency (and simplicity in milter-ahead), a hostname
   	can also appear in square brackets ie. [host]:port.

   +	aclocal.m4, configure.in: added --enable-fcntl-locks to use
   	LibSnert's own flock(), which is a cover function to fcntl(),
   	lockf(), or locking(). Linux prefers fcntl() locking.

   !	berkeley.h, kvm.c, Cache.c: The DBTXN * argument was not
	supplied to db->associate, open, rename, and remove until BDB
	4.1 (grrr). Added macro to handle this difference between 4.0
	and 4.1.

   !	kvm.c: Clear the SQLite data structure on allocation before
   	opening an .sq3. If the .sq3 or its location does not exist,
   	the kvm_close_sql() would segfault trying to cleanup bogus
   	pointers.

--1.63.892--

   !	Updated the two-level-tlds.txt and tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt.

--1.63--

   +	Added sys/rlimits.c for dumping process limits to syslog().

   +	smfMainStart() now dumps the milter's process limits for
   	verbose=debug.

   +	Added isReservedIPv4().

   +	Added mfReply() et co. which will eventually replace the
   	smfReply() family.

   +	Added kvm.[ch] to provide a low level API that handles socket
	maps, Berkeley DB files, and SQLite3. There are also two CLI
	utilities, kvmc & kvmd, that can be used to test the API.

   +	kvm.c: supports linking with both BDB 1.85 and a newer BDB at
	the same time. For read-only access, the code will autodetect
	earlier 1.85 hash/btree or newer hash/btree formats. NOTE that
	BDB 1.85 is NOT OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED and barely tolerated
	unofficially.

   !	smdb.[ch]: overhauled to use the kvm API and so support either
	Berkeley DB, socket maps, and/or SQLite. This allows most of
	the milters to use access-db settings of the following form:

		[table-name![read-only!]type![sub-type!]]location

	The following maps forms of type![sub-type!]location are
	supported:

 		NULL				(assumes hash!)
 		hash!				(in memory hash)
		text!/path/map.txt		(flat text file)
		/path/map.db			(original, BDB hash)
		db!/path/map.db			(BDB hash)
		db!btree!/path/map.db		(BDB btree)
		multicast!group:port!map	(broadcast & store)
		sql!/path/database		(SQLite3)
		socketmap!host:port		(internet socket)
		socketmap!/path/local/socket	(local socket)

	Note the schema used for SQLite3 is:

		CREATE TABLE kvm (
			k BLOB PRIMARY KEY,
			v BLOB
		);

	If the SQLite database doesn't exist, it will be created with
	the table above.

   !	smfAccessRcpt() added missing curly brackets to popauth_info
   	block. Reported by Mike Elliot.

   !	Increased default Hash table size from 997 to 4093.

   +	socket2.[ch]: Added socketMulticast(), socketSetReuse(),
   	socketGetError().

   !	Dns.c, socketTimeoutIO.c: moved socketTimeoutIO() into its
   	own file from Dns.c.

   !	socketAddressGetString() now takes an extra flag to include
   	the port number with the string.

   !	tools/flip: can act as a pipe filter, changing newlines read
   	from standard input and write to standard output.

  !!	smtpOpen.c: mxResponse(); fixed memory corruption bug caused
	by advancing the very array pointer we need to later free.

  !!	smtpOpen.c: smtpAddRcpt(); fixed incorrect size of recipient
  	structure allocated, which could cause a memory overrun.

  !!	smtpRead(): fixed possible memory corruption bug when reading
	multiline responses due to incorrect advancing of the offset
	index.

   !	smtpAddRcpt(): dropped new_connection flag.

   !	networkGetMyDetails() now sets the host name according to
	machine name returned by gethostname(), which is passed to
	gethostbyname() to get the official FQDN as outlined by Linux
	hostname(1).

   +	smf.c: Added milter-queue option to specify the libmilter's
   	setting for the sendmail / milter connection queue size. The
   	default is 20.

  !!	smfAccessPattern(): some reported errors incorrectly included
   	the work space pointer in place of a string.

   !	smtpAddRcpt() now sets the MX socket non-blocking.

   !	uri.[ch]: moved TEXT_VS_INLINE macro definition from .c to .h
   	to resolve possible mismatched structure sizes.

   !	spfCheck(): added TextNull() wrapper around alt_txt argument.

  !!	spfMacro(): fixed possible memory leak when processing %p.

   !	spfCheck()/spfMacro(): fixed bug in handling of ptr method or
	%p. The ptr test neglected to check the validated IP / host
	domain against the target name as outlined in RFC 4408.
	Reported by Dave Tanner.

   !	smf.c: getMyDetails() rewritten.

   !	Add socketAddressGetIPv6() to copy IPv4 or IPv6 socket
   	addres into an IPV6_BYTE_LENGTH buffer.

   +	Added isIPv4InClientName().

   !	DebugMalloc() now sets the whole allocated area including
	upper and lower boundary areas to 0xdf to more easily identify
	freed memory. Also when allocating a chunk, the boundary below
	the MemoryMarker structure is set to 0xda while above the
	marker to the start of the chunk is set to 0xd0 to more easily
	distinguish where the marker is sitting.

   !	DebugRealloc() corrected computation of MemoryMarker
	structure.

   +	Added optionString(), optionStringV().

   !	smfAccessClient(), smfAccessPattern(): when using the default
	pattern list, be sure to pass the client IP address so that
	net/cidr patterns can be matched. smfAccessPattern() will only
	apply net/cidr patterns if the haystack is an IP address.

   !	smfActionPattern() fixed bug where a NEXT action returned
   	SMDB_ACCESS_UNKNOWN instead of SMDB_ACCESS_NOT_FOUND, when
   	the action value was not to be passed back.

   +	ProcTitle.c fixed to support Linux.

   !	Fixed old convertDate() porting error concerning time zones
	from milter-date. Reported by Jim Hermann.

   !	convertDate() now skips leading white space before trying to
   	parse the date string.  Reported by Jim Hermann.

   !	spfCheck(): fixed returned error w.r.t. to TXT record lookup
   	not being found according RFC 4408 SPF Classic section 4.3.
   	and 4.4.

   +	Added socketSetKeepAlive().

   !	socketWrite(), socketWriteTo() changed to support the sending
	of a zero-length packet. This probably depends on the
	underlying socket implementation.

   !	uri.c: spanDomain() now treats double dots in the domain name
   	as illegal, eg. https://smallbusiness..dell.com/ should not
   	parse.

   -	Dropped uri-implicit-domain-min-dots in favour of a constant
   	value of 2 for MIME content filtering. A value of one can
   	result in too many false positives.

   +	Added uriParse2() which can be passed as an extra argument
   	the implicit-domain-min-dots when using the function to test
   	URIs that didn't originate in message content.

   +	Add SQLite3 support for kvm and mcc APIs. Integrated SQLite3
   	distrobution with LibSnert. Use an explicit --with-sqlite3 or
   	--without-sqlite3 to disable.

   +	Added mcc (multicast & unicast cache) API.

   !	aclocal.m4/configure.in: --without-db can be used to disable
	linking with all new Berkeley DB versions other than the old
	1.85.

   !	aclocal.m4/configure.in: Take care in detecting libpam,
	libsqlite3, librt, libpthread, since they're often an .so and
	not all my software requires them. However, by detecting it,
	its automatically added to $LIBS and so a version specific
	reference could end up appearing in the dynamic library start
	sequence. If the library has a major update, the old one
	deleted, and the application didn't really need the library,
	then it will refuse to start due to library version change.
	End result, try to link with only those libraries that an
	application requires. Reported by Andrey Chernov

  !!	Dns.c, spf.c: Fixed bug in the processing of TXT record
  	lengths that could result in the extra NUL byte writing
  	into memory (way) outside our allocated data/string buffer.

   !	Cleaned up assorted minor compiler warnings for 64-bit SuSE
   	Linux concerning the signedness of arguments. Requested by
   	Gary Faith.

   !	Added null pointer guard to md5_append() for "data" argument.

   !	DebugMalloc: Added to a simple CRC check of the marker.

   +	Added TextInputLine2() and TextReadLine2().

   !	DnsGet(): When trying to resolve MX, NS, or similar records,
	if one of the A / AAAA lookups failed, then the whole list was
	discarded and an undefined result given. Now it returns a
	partially complete answer. This fix also allows RFC 2317
	reverse dns delegation (CNAME -> PTR) to work.

   !	Cache.c: Fixed compiler error when using --enable-cache-db-185.
   	Reported by Jay West. Note that support for Berkeley DB 1.85
   	was dropped two or three years ago.

   !	spfCheck(): fix bug concerning RFC 4408 section 5. Mechanism
	Definitions last paragraph with respect to the failure of
	subordinate DNS requests, ie. when server DNS recusion is off
	and you have a successful MX lookup followed by A records
	lookups that are undefined you would receive TempError,
	instead of simply continuing processing the as per the RFC.

   +	Added isReservedTLD() as a means to select which RFC 2606
	or similar reserved domains should be tested for. isRFC2606()
	is now just a cover function for isReservedTLD(path, ~0).

   !	parsePath.c, MailSpan.c: only allowed backslash escaping
	within a quoted string, which is correct according to RFC 2822
	grammar for the local-part, eg. <"quoted\\string"@example.com>.
	However, it appears that sendmail will accept backslash
	escapes outside of a quoted string too, eg.
	<escape\ space@example.com> As this might be an oversight by
	RFC 2822 and backslash escape is a common idiom in and out of
	quoted strings, I've elected to support it. Reported by
	Dariusz Walczak.

   !	Updated libmilter version handling in smf.c for sendmail 8.14
	changes, in particular the changes concerning SMFI_VERSION.

   !	version.h now defines __unix__ if __unix is defined, because
	some C compilers, like for SunOS 5.8, only define the latter,
	while I use the former. Reported by Mathew Huff.

   !	Dns.c: If UDP response was truncated, then return a Not
	Implemented error (4) instead of OK, since we don't support
	TCP lookups yet. This should avoid possible parsing errors due
	to chopped records.

   !	spf.c: If the DNS TXT lookup returns Not Implemented, then be
	sure to return a None instead of Temp. Fail.

--1.62--

   +	Added socketBind() to allow for binding client sockets to
   	a local address and/or port.

   !	Changed smtpError.c in favour of using error codes instead
   	of constant error strings. Its easier to classify based on
   	an error code between SMTP, I/O, and internal errors.

   !	smtpOpen.c smtpRead.c, smtpWrite.c now use SMTP_ERROR_ codes.

   +	smtpGetError() added a function to return a short SMTP error
   	message.

   !	smfAccessHost() changed testing of loopback address from using
	{if_addr} macro to testing the {client_addr}. Postfix 2.3
	milter support does not support the {if_addr} macro.

   +	smdbAccessCode() now recognises Postfix 2.3 DUNNO action which
   	is equivalent to Sendmail SKIP action.

   +	smfAccessHost(): Postfix 2.3 uses "unknown" for client_name
   	when there is no rDNS result instead of an IP-as-domain-literal
   	"[123.45.67.89]" which Sendmail uses. Test and exclude "unknown"
   	from reject-unknown-tld test.

   +	Added experimental option -smdb-key-has-nul for Postfix 2.3
	where postmap(1) is used to generate .db files. When set, key
	lookups add one for the C string terminating NUL byte.

   +	smf.c: added smdb-use-stat and smdb-key-has-nul to the common
   	set of options for milters.

   !	smfOpenProlog(): When raw_client_addr is NULL assume address
	is 127.0.0.1. Postfix 2.3 invokes xxfi_connect handler with
	client_name="localhost" and client_addr=NULL instead of the IP
	address. The libmilter documentation states that client_addr
	is on NULL for stdin or unsupported socket type. So assuming
	127.0.0.1 is probably the safest.

   +	uriIsDomainBL(), uriIsHostBL(): Added a bit-mask facility to
	handle aggregate lists like multi.surbl.org.


--1.61--

   !	uri.c: The CLI now returns exit code 1 for errors or when a
   	black listing is found.

   !	uri.c: cid: and mid: URIs are no longer confused as a email
   	addresses.

   !	uri.c: spanScheme() failed to stop on non-scheme characters.

   !	uri.c: spanDomain() failed to disallow hyphen as the start
   	of a domain label.

   !	uri.c: spanDomain() asserts that the TLD is alpha only.

   +	uri.c: Added test & option for empty text/plain vs. inline
   	content.

   !	uri.c: mimeGetUri() now skips top level message/rfc822 part
	containing mail header information, but does test the
	remaining sub-parts of the message/rfc822.

   !	TextMatch(): fixed bug related to using a ``stop'' pointer
   	and memory wrap around when hay_size was set to "unlimited".

   +	uri.c: mimeGetUri() added hack to detect qmail failure
	notices, because qmail is too stupid to use the MIME
	message/report formatting.

   +	Added new option.[ch] as a getopt() alternative.

   !	uriParse() will try to parse something without a scheme first
	as domain name, second as an email address.

   !	mimeGetUri() no longer prefixes addresses it thinks might
   	look like a host name or mail address. It leaves uriParse()
   	to figure it out.

   !	uriHttpOrigin() fixed to better handle URIs without a scheme
   	that might be an http: reference.

   !	smf.c, smdb.c: use option.[ch] in place of smfSetFlags() and
	smdbSetFlags(). More flexible and allows for library options
	to be set more universally from the command line and/or
	options file.

   !	uri.c: uriIsDNSBL() broken into uriIsHostBL() and uriIsDomainBL().
   	uriIsDomainBL() domain & sub-domain lookups from surbl.org and
   	uribl.com. uriIsHostBL() handles host/IP lookups from classic
   	DNS BL, like spamhaus.org.

   -	uri.c: CLI -b option removed in favour of just using -d.

   +	parsePath.[ch]:Added IS_IP_THIS_HOST for 0.0.0.0/32 and IPv6:::0.
	Previously it was group under IS_IP_THIS_NET, but RFC 3330
	defines "this" host and it can be useful to test for.

   !	smf.[ch]: Many changes in preparation to switch from old to
   	new preferred option style.

   !	aclocal.m4: Debugging is off by default.

   !	siq: Added "expires" member to SIQ structure as a convenience.
   	This is the timestamp when the response was received, plus the
   	response TTL. This simplifies some code with respect to caching
   	in milter-siq.

   !	socketAddressCreate() now correctly sets the socket length
	structure member when HAVE_STRUCT_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN is define,
	this impacted UDP packets being sent using socketWriteTo().

   !	socketReadFrom(): the `from' argument can be NULL.

   !	isReservedIPv6(): IS_IP_V6 has been added as the complimentary
	classification to IS_IP_V4; also IS_IP_V4_COMPATIBLE and
	IS_IP_V4_MAPPED can now be individually tested for.

   +	Added TextFind() that returns the offset of the start of found
   	text.

   +	Added sys/pid.[ch] for PID file support; some functions moved
   	from smf.c.

   +	Added io/network.[ch] for network support functions; moved
	networkContainsIp() from spf.c and smf.c to here; added
	networkGetMyDetails()

  !!	smfAccessClient(): When an access lookup matches an IP and a
	network/cidr is specified on the RHS, the client_name was
	incorrectly passed to smfAccessPattern() instead of
	client_addr, which causes an IP parse error. Reported by Ryan
	Weaver.

   !	Changed LogPrintV handling of newlines and ASCII control
   	characters.

   !	socketAddressCreate(): fixed bug where specifying an IPv4
   	this-host (0.0.0.0) was flaged as IPv6.

   +	socketReadLine2() added with an extra boolean parameter to
   	indicate whether to keep the CRLF in the line buffer.

   +	smtpRead() added to read and return multiline response.

   +	smtpWrite() simplified version similar to smtpPrintLine().

   !	VectorRemoveAll(): Added NULL pointer guard.

   !	DnsInit(), DnsGet(): now handles /etc/hosts lookups.

   !	Dns.c: nameLength() and nameCopy() now return the root segment
   	"." instead of an empty string.

   +	New SMTP rountines that simplify some of the grunt work of
	writing simple send message routines, sending long messages
	(+64K), and multiple recipients: smtpOpen, smtpClose,
	smtpAddRcpt, smtpPrint, smtpPrintf, smtpPrintfV,
	smtpTimeoutGet, smtpTimeoutSet, smtpAssertCRLF. Intended for
	use in milter-report.

   -	mail/smtp.c has been dropped in favour of the above mentioned
   	smtp API.

   !	smfAccessMail(), smfAccessRcpt() fixed "unknown TLD" for IP-
    	as-domain literals, which are not TLDs and so should not be
    	tested.

   !	Fixed bug in mimeGetUri() boundary handling code that could
	cause a change in MIME content-type inappropiately. Reported
	by Ken Anderson.

--1.60.816--

   !	util/makefile.in: fix build of uri CLI on some platforms like
   	Solaris. Reported by Rieder Dietmar.

--1.60--

   - 	Removed io/URI.c. It wasn't as complete as I would have liked
   	and decided to start over.

   +	Added util/uri.c for parsing a URI string into its component
	parts. Also provides assorted span functions, uriHttpOrigin(),
	uriIsSURBL(), and mimeGetUri(). It can also be built as a CLI
	for testing.

   -	DebugMalloc.h removed from distribution. Its not required for
	the current implementation.

   !	tlds.c: Added hasValidNthTLD(), indexValidTLD(), indexValidNthTLD().

   !	tlds.c: An empty string is not a valid TLD.

   !	TextMatch() has extra arguments to limit the size of the haystack
   	and flag case-insensitive match.

   !	smfReplyV(): Changed "reply..." message from SMF_LOG_INFO to
	SMF_LOG_TRACE. Typically the reply message is reported in the
	mail log by sendmail anyways.

   +	Added TextCat(), similar to strlcat() for systems that don't
   	supply strlcat().

   !	socketClient(): Assert that so_error is zero before calling
   	getsockopt(SO_ERROR).

   +	smf.h: added LIBMILTER_SOCKET_TIMEOUT constant (7210) since
	the libmilter headers don't provide one. See smfi_settimeout()
	documentation.

   !	spf.c: Fixed redirect= so that the domain passed to the
	recusive spfCheck() is an independant copy of the macro
	buffer. Reported by Mike Elliott.

   !	spf.c: Fixed handling of ptr mechanism to account for multi-
	homed hosts. Reported by Mike Elliott.

   !	smfMainStart(): Add guard against incorrect setting of
	--localstatedir and --enable-pid file in milter ./configure
	scripts to base system directories which could inadvertantly
	change the directory ownership and permissions. Reported by
	Steve Freegard.

   !	spf.c: Fixed support for dual-cidr-length used for A and MX
   	mechanisms.

   !	spf.c: If a ptr mechanism fails on the forward DNS lookup,
	proceed to the next clause instead of giving an error. More
	fault tolerent of difficult ISPs. Suggested by Mike Elliott.

   +	spf.c: Added spfCheckHeloMailTxt() and -t option for the CLI
	to specify an initial TXT record to start with instead of
	looking up the SPF record of the sender. Suggested by Mike
	Elliott. This can simplify testing.

   !	spf.c: Falling off the end of the SPF record that does not
	contain an ``all'' or ``redirect'' clause, failed to set the
	default result correctly to Neutral. Reported by Mike Elliott.


--1.59--

   !	smfReplyV(): If the format string starts with an extended
	status code, then use that instead of that provided by ecode.
	This allows functions like parsePath() to return strings with
	the extended status code it thinks better corresponds to the
	error.

   !	berkeley_db.h: removed last #error message when there is no
	linkable Berkeley DB defined. Solves build issues when
	building Cygwin mingw library.

   !	Cache.c, smdb.[ch], smf.c: replaced LIBSNERT_WITH_BERKELEY_DB
	by HAVE_DB_H. They are effectively equivalent now.

   !	socket2.c: socketOpen() fixed opening of unix domain sockets
   	returning unsupported protocol error, EPROTONOSUPPORT.

   !	tools/clamstream.c: fixed -H with unix domain sockets.

   !	socket2.c: socketAddressLength() returned the incorrect
	structure length for unix domain sockets, which caused an
	EINVAL error on Linux 2.4 kernel (and maybe others) at
	connect() time.

   !	Updated TLD list from IANA.

--1.58--

   !	smdbGetValueInternal() added missing argument to syslog()
   	error message.

   !	socketAddressCreate(): added NULL guard for host/ip string.

   !	socketClient(): clear errno before connect() to be sure we
	don't fail the connection for a previous unrelated error.

   !	smdbAccessIp(): fixed off-by-one erro concerning the handling
	of IPv6 address with an "IPv6:" prefix not being properly
	stripped before lookup. Reported by Panagiotis Christias.


--1.57--

   !	spfNetworkContains(), networkContainsIp(): When a network/CIDR
	is specified, be sure to apply the mask to both the IP address
	being tested and the network address, because in some
	instances the network address is not properly specified, ie:
	10.123.45.67/8 is valid, but confusing when the network
	address should be 10.0.0.0/8. Reported by Steve Sladewig and
	Derek Balling.

   +	Added special flag +smtp-auth-ok to allow people the ability
	to enable/disable use of SMTP+AUTH for white listing. Some
	ISPs do not trust their clients enough to allow them to bypass
	milters.

   +	Enhanced smfAccess*() to support empty tag lookups as a means
	to provide global defaults for B/W listing. This only works
	for milter specific tags and NOT sendmail tags (connect:,
	from:, spam:, or to:)

   +	Added smfAccessAuth() to support the ability to lookup the
   	tagged {auth_authen} macro and pass the result through the
   	RHS pattern list.

	  tag:auth_authen			RHS
	  tag:auth_authen:			RHS

   !	Fixed memory leak in smfAccess*() functions after introduction
   	of smfAccessPattern() semantics.

   !	isRFC2606() now knows about .localdomain despite its NOT being
   	in RFC 2606.

   !	smfMainStart() now asserts that the directory used by the pid
   	file exists. OpenBSD and possibly others remove all the contents
   	of /var/run including subdirectories on server restart.

   !	aclocal.m4: Changed the SNERT_OPTION_ENABLE_CACHE_FILE macro
	to append a .db file extension. This make it easier to use
	makemap(1) to dump the cache, since it always appends a .db
	extension to the filename.

   +	Cache.c: Added BDB file locking code.

   +	Dns: DnsEntry now has members for the original address length
   	and a string representation of the address. This reduces the
   	need for isReservedIPv6(IS_IP_V4) and formatIP() for some
   	callers.

   !	smdb.c: Added snprintf() overflow checks in case the
	smdbAccess*() functions are called with exceptionally long
	strings. Otherwise they can go into exceptionally long loops
	that do unpredictable things that could crash the process.

   !	mkpath(): fixed creation of absolute directory paths.
	Previously only relative ones could be done.

   !	Dns.c, Socket2.c: implemented support for huge file descriptor
	sets when using select() on unix systems.

   !	smtpSendMessageV() changed to break the MX connection loop
   	on SMTP session and I/O errors, but not connection errors.

   !	smfAccessRcpt() now excludes <postmaster> from the valid TLD test.

   !	socketClient(): Replaced non-portable "liberal" connection
   	technique for blocking sockets, with a non-blocking connect()
   	and a defined default timeout.

   !	smfReplyV() now replaces non-printable characters with spaces
   	since smfi_setreply() will fail otherwise.

   !	CacheBdbWalk(): added NULL pointer checks of DBT.data fields
	after cursor->c_get(), since we use DB_DBT_REALLOC flag which
	might result in NULL being passed back.

   !	smfOpenProlog(): changed to use formatIP().

   !	smfAccess*(): changed wording of white listed entries to just
	say "OK" instead of "white listed, skipping", since sometimes
	message does not make sense or is misleading in the caller's
	context.

   !	smtpSendMessageV() now does isReservedIPv6() and hasValidTLD()
   	tests on the MX.

   +	Complete rewrite of DebugMalloc memory debugging code into
   	something useable for OpenBSD, Linux, and Windows; thread-safe
   	and reentrant. Useful for catching double-free, over/under runs,
   	and invalid pointers.

   +	aclocal.m4: add SNERT_FIND_LIBC and SNERT_SETJMP macros. The
   	find libc macro is used by DebugMalloc.

   !	CacheBdbOpen(): disabled verification of cache before opening.
   	Possible malloc/free issue.

   !	aclocal.m4: added test to SNERT_CHECK_CONFIGURE to find either
   	autoconf-2.59 or autoconf. OpenBSD packages install an autoconf
   	with a version number.

   !	socketAddressToString(): specified the wrong constant for the
   	string buffer size.

   !	socketAccept(): if accept() returned an error other than EINTR
	then the client socket structure would be freed, but the
	function failed to return NULL because of a typo ("c == NULL;"
	should have been "c = NULL;"). This would likely cause memory
	corruption and unpredictable behaviour.

   !	aclocal.m4, berkeley_db.h, version.h.in.in: updated Berkeley DB
   	header and library discovery. See SNERT_BERKELEY_DB.

   !	parseIPv6(): fixed segmentation fault caused by parsing an
	unsually long IPv6 styled string like "1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:a:b"

   !	nameLength(), nameCopy(), nameSkip(): added lots of bounds
   	checking of offsets and pointers within the packet, since we
   	cannot blindly trust 3rd party DNS sources (bad implementaion,
   	corruption, hacking).

   !	smfAccessRcpt(): The address <postmaster> was excluded from
   	TLD testing. This has been expanded to include <postmaster@...>
   	for site internal domains.

   !	parsePath() no longer lowers the case of the localRight portion
	of the path. This might be a folder name, hash, or token, which
	could be case sensitive.

   !	smfAccessHost() now tests the {if_addr} macro instead of
	client_addr string for detecting the loopback interface.

--1.56--

   +	Moved new socket.[ch] API from Roundhouse into LibSnert as
	io/socket2.c and io/socket2.h. This socket API supports IPv6.

   !	socket2.h: Fixed #define order of SHUT_RDWR and co. to be
   	after the inclusion of sys/socket.h where these constants
   	are defined.

   +	Added socketShutdown() cover function to socket2 API.

   +	Moved clamstream.c from Roundhouse into tools, since it
   	uses the socket2 API and is not related to Roundhouse.

   !	mail/siq.c, mail/smtp.c, tools/popin.c, tools/smtpout.c now
   	use the socket2 API.

   -	io/Message.[ch] and io/MessageStream.[ch] removed. This was
   	leftover code from a previous job and no longer used.

   +	Added hasValidTLD() based on publisbled IANA list from
   	http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt

   +	smfAccessHost(), smfAccessMail, smfAccessRcpt() now check for
   	unknown/illegal TLDs, default -Z +reject-unknown-tld.

   !	siq.c: more detailed usage description.

   !	LogOpen("(standard error)") now opens the log file on standard
   	error. Implemented for Roundhouse.

   !	Dns.c: nameLength() now performs an upper bounds check against
   	the max. length of a domain name in order to guard against odd
   	or corrupted packets that exceed this.

   !	Dns.c: nameLength() and nameCopy() parse code did not handle
	compression jumps to a root (zero length) label correctly.
	This would result often in a busy loop that would drive up the
	CPU. Reported by Kevins Brooks.

   !	aclocal.m4: Changed SNERT_OPTION_ENABLE_PID and
	SNERT_OPTION_ENABLE_SOCKET to accept optional default paths.

   !	spf.c: spfNetworkContains() now checks the range of the CIDR
   	value.

   !	spf.c: spfCheck() now returns a PermError for an out of range
   	CIDR value.

   !	aclocal.m4, smfSetProcessOwner() has to set the supplemental
	groups.

   !	spf.c: fixed handling of null address according to SPF-Classic
   	Internet Draft section 2.2

   !	spf.c: fixed handling of qualifiers applied to an include.
   	The result of the include evaluation was incorrectly being
   	returned instead of the qualifier for the include if the
   	evaluation passed. Reported by Mike Elliott.

--1.55--

   !	siq.[ch]: Added #define constants for negative score
	definitions as specified in SIQ draft 02.

   !	getSiqScoreA() now correctly sets the SIQ.score member
   	to RESPONSE_ERROR for any client error conditions.

   !	siq.[ch]: The SIQ structure now returns the extra_length
   	and extra data portions of the response as defined in
   	SIQ draft 02.

--1.54--

   !	spf.c: fix bug in comparison of host name returned from a PTR
   	lookup, where the host name will have a trailing root dot,
   	but the result of spfMacro() doesn't and so the test to see
   	if a host name ends with the consulted SPF domain failed.
   	Reported by Derek Balling.

   !	setBitWord2() modified to support optional +/- prefixes on
   	flag words.

   +	smdbSetFlags() added to support experimental or internal
	runtime options, default "-Z -smdb-use-stat".

   !	smfSetFlags() also calls smdbSetFlags().

   +	New NEXT action is a Snert milter extension that can only be
	used with milter specific tags in access.db.

   	Normally when the access.db lookup matches a milter tag, then
	RHS regex pattern list is processed and there are no further
	access.db lookups possible.

   	The NEXT action allows the access.db lookups to resume and is
	effectively the opposite of SKIP.

   	Consider the following trival example:

   		milter-NAME-from:com	/@com/REJECT NEXT
   		From:com		OK

   	would reject mail from places like compaq.com or com.com if
	the pattern matches, but resume the the access.db lookups
	otherwise.

   	Now consider this more complex example concerning the format
	of aol.com mail addresses. AOL local parts are between 3 and
	16 characters long and can contain dots and RFC 2822 atext
	characters except % and /.

   	First is what might be specified if NEXT were not possible:

   		milter-NAME-from:aol.com  /^.{1,2}@aol.com$/REJECT /^[^@]{17,}@aol.com$/REJECT /[%\/]/REJECT
   		From:fred@aol.com	OK
   		From:john@aol.com	OK

   	Now consider this shorter version using NEXT:

   		milter-NAME-from:aol.com  /^[a-zA-Z0-9!#$&'*+=?^_`{|}~.-]{3,16}@aol.com$/NEXT REJECT
   		From:fred@aol.com	OK
   		From:john@aol.com	OK

   	The NEXT used above allowed me to specify one simple regex
	instead of (a complex one using alternation or) three in order
	to validate the format aol.com address and then proceed to
	lookup white listed and/or black listed addresses.

--1.53--

   !	smdbGetValue() add NULL pointer guards.

   !	smfAccessPattern() changed to allow for an arbitrary "action"
   	to be returned, such as an email address (see milter-bcc).

   !	Fixed smfAccessPattern() pattern delimiter scanning. RFC 2822
	allows exclamation (!) and slash (/) characters to be part of
	the local-part of an address and so must be escaped in order
	to match.

   !	parsePath(): some minor changes for when strict-syntax
	checking is disabled with respect to whitespace.

   !	aclocal.m4: fixed the double expansion issues of some
	configure variables that are passed into .h or .c files
	(CACHE_FILE, PID_FILE, and SOCKET_FILE).

   !	aclocal.m4: renamed SNERT_OPTION_ENABLE_WIN32 to
   	SNERT_OPTION_ENABLE_MINGW

   !	Dns.c: Fixed DnsInit() for Windows to always get the size of
   	GetNetworkParams() buffer, which can vary.

   !	Dns.c: Add more error handling when using VectorAdd().

   !	Dns.c: Overhauled internal function DnsResolve() for clarity.

  !!	spf.c: Fix problem concerning multihomed MX records. Reported
   	by Tristan Griffiths.

   !	smfAccessRcpt(), smfWork: Add new skipRecipient field for
	white listing per recipient only, instead of white listing the
	whole message once any white listed recipient is seen. In the
	milters that act on skipRecipient, spam software that send to
	multiple RCPTs per SMTP transaction and hit a white listed
	RCPT, would not impact all the other RCPTs. Requested by
	Sergey Stepanov. Impacts milter-gris, milter-spamc, and others.

   !	MailSpan.c: allow underscore in domain names. Used for RFC
	2782 SRV record suport. Reported by Ben Lentz.

  !!	smfSetFileOwner() now checks for unix: or local: prefix on
   	the file name in case its a libmilter unix domain socket.
   	This removes the need for a milter to be seteuid() and can
   	instead can simply setuid(milter) for better security.

   	As a result smfSetProcessOwner() now sets setuid() instead
   	of seteuid() and does more error checking of the results.
   	Thus smfAtExitCleanUp() no longer needs to revert back to
   	root in order to delete the unix socket, since it will have
   	the same ownership as the process.

   	This only works when a more recent version of libmilter that
   	supports smfi_opensocket() is present.

--1.52--

   !	aclocal.m4: Fix AC_LANG(C) macro to place a space in between
	the -o option and its argument for GCC 3.

   !	Dns.c: Use protected includes of sys/time.h and time.h for Mac
	OS X.

   !	version.h.in.in: Max OS X does not define __unix__ even though
	its unix under the hood. Add #ifdef __APPLE__ to define
	__unix__.

   !	Make sure #include <com/snert/lib/version.h> appears first in
	several .c files, particularly before any use of #ifdef
	__unix__.

   !	version.h.in.in: Added typedef for socklen_t, which is not
	defined for SunOS (size_t) and Mac OS X (int).

   !	Socket.[ch]: Resolve compiler warnings for Mac OS X related to
	socklen_t.

   !	aclocal.m4: Added type check for socklen_t.

   !	TokenSplitA(): fix bug where an extra empty argument is added
   	to the array when splitting options from a text file, because
   	of the last newline.

   !	TokenSplitA() no longer zeros the 0 to offset-1 array entries.
   	This allows an array to be built up through repeated calls to
   	TokenSplitA().

   !	TokenSplitA() no longer takes an initial offset argument.

   !	Dns.c: DnsInit() for Windows now uses GetNetworkParams() to get
   	the default list of DNS servers.

   !	smf.c, Socket.c: fix type of size argument to match SUSv3.
	OpenBSD 3.6 defines a size_t for size, while SUSv3 uses
	socklen_t. These can end up being different byte lengths on
	64-bit architectures. Reported by Kevin Rosenberg.

	  const char *
	  inet_ntop(int af, const void *restrict src,
	  	char *restrict dst, socklen_t size);

   !	Dns.c: Replaced sizeof (long) and sizeof (short) with constants
   	for network long and short types, which are 32 and 16 bites by
   	definition. On an AMD 64 machine, this would blow up very
   	dramatically because the long C type is 64 bits instead of 32.

   !	smtp.c: Fixed free() of bogus buffer value.

   !	siq.[ch] CLI supports Internet draft-irtf-asrg-iar-howe-siq-02.txt
   	with some backwards compatibility detection for drafts 00 and 01.

   !	siq.c: fixed seg.fault in siq CLI.

   -	io/stdopen.c dropped. Only three testing tools remained using it.
   	Dropped in favour of a simplier solution that worked better with
   	Cygwin/mingw libraries.

   !	tools/uue.c,kat.c,cksum.c modifed to use simplified private copies
   	of stdopen.c, which has been dropped.

   !	smdb.c: readSendmailCf() can now open virtusertable.db. Intend for
   	milter-report.

   !	smtp CLI testing tool for Windows now initialises winsock.

--1.51--

  !!	spf.c: spfCheck(): Fixed double release of memory bug. Reported
  	by Jan Holmberg.

--1.50--

   +	Add smtpSendString() to smtp.c.

   !	More smtpSendMessage*() API changes.

  !!	spf.c: Fix circular reference bug caused by domains like
  	budgetdialup.com that have two SPF records including each
  	other. Requested by Derek Balling.

   +	spf.c: Add DNS lookup limits as outlined in the Internet
   	draft for DNS related mechanisms and %{p} macros.

   +	grey.[ch]: Added grey-listing code as a library function.

   +	TextMatch.[ch]: Added simple pattern matching function that
   	supports '*' and '?' wild cards.

   +	smf.c: Added support to smfAccess*() functions to allow for
	pattern matching. A tagged access.db value can now specify a
	list of patterns to apply for an IP, host name, MAIL, or RCPT.
	For example:

   	  milter-NAME-from:example.com	!fred@*!REJECT /^[^.]+\.smith@.*/DISCARD OK

   	Would reject mail from fred@example.com, discard mail from
	any.smith@example.com, and accept the rest. Note that there
	are two supported patterns mechanisms: simple * ? matching and
	exteneded regex.

   +	aclocal.m4: Added SNERT_REGEX to look for the standard POSIX
	Regular Expression API.

   !	aclocale.m4: Fix SNERT_LIBMILTER detection of libmilter and
	package loading for Debian.

  !!	Fixed bug in smdb_open() that caused milters to crash when
	access.db is updated. Reported by Joe Matuscak.

--1.49--

   !	With some versions of gcc 3.x smtpSendMessageV() and
	smtpMessage can not pass a va_list around and assign it a
	structure member. It would appear that it can only be pass
	around as a function argument once assigned.

   +	smf.c, aclocal.m4, configure.in, version.h.in.in: Added new
	compile time option --enable-popauth to enable code to test a
	the sendmail macro {popauth_info} when used with dracd.
	Similar in bahaviour to {auth_authen}. Requested by Michael
	Elliott. See contrib directory for notes.

   !	Fixed smtpSend* bug for milter-report. The result of rushing a
   	fix out for SPF in 1.48, while in the middle of other changes.

   +	spf.c: Fix recursion for include: mechanism. Fix suggested by
   	Matanya Elchanani.

--1.48--

   !	smtpSendMessageV() neglected to send a QUIT command.

   !	smtpSendMessageV() will now except a NULL message and skip the
   	DATA command.

   !	smtpSend*() function signatures changed.

   !	Added smtpErrorBusy, smtpErrorNoService error messages.

   !	SocketOpenTcpClientWait(): The change back to a blocking
	socket is done right after the connect() and before the
	select(). Otherwise on Windows, we get WSAEWOULDBLOCK (10035)
	on the select().

   !	spf.c: fix bug in recursive handling of SPF records.

   !	spf.c: fix string comparison bug concerning "all" and "a"
   	mechanisms.

   +	Added DnsError* string constants to Dns.h.

   +	ParsePath. Added isWhiteListed convenience member to the
   	structure.

--1.47--

   +	Added reverseSegments() to Dns.c.

   +	Added strlrspn() and strlcspn() taken from hibachi/2.10 code.

   +	spf.c: Added spfCheckMail() and spfCheckHeloMail(). Implemented
   	the missing %{s}, %{l}, %{o}, %{h}, and %{p} macros and
   	transformations.

--1.46--

   +	Buf.[ch]: Added BufCreateWithString() for use in milter-report.

   !	Buf.[ch]: Renamed BufFrom*() to BufCreateFrom*() to correspond
	the naming convention used by Data.h

   +	Cache.c: Added CacheRemoveAll() for all three cache types.

   !	Moved cover functions gmtime_r() and localtime_r() from Time.c
	into gmtime_r.c. These functions will use a static POSIX mutex
	when available, otherwise they are not thread safe.

   +	Added cover functions for ctime_r() and asctime_t(). These
	functions will use a static POSIX mutex when available,
	otherwise they are not thread safe (yet).

   +	Added sys/pthread.[ch] for emulation of POSIX thread & mutexes
   	for Windows. Taken from hibachi 2.

   -	DebugMalloc.c: Removed POSIX mutex emulation for Windows.

   +	Added util/ProcTitle.[ch] for Tick Cafe 3 CGIs.

   +	Added setBitWord2() to accept a delimiter string.

   !	smfOpenProlog() uses a private mutex now, instead of smfMutex.

   +	DnsOpen() will now invoke DnsInit() if necessary.

   !	DnsGet() would return a name not found error for an MX lookup
   	if any of the MX in the list did not resolve. Now we return
   	the partial list. Reported by Didi Rieder.

   !	Moved SMTP_IS_* macros from smf.h to smtp.h.

   +	Added SMTP_ISS_* macros to smtp.h. Similar to SMTP_IS_* but
   	checks the first ASCII digit of a response code.

   +	Added SMF_LOG_ERROR category for consistency and is always
	logged.

   !	smfReplyV() changed "reply %s %s %s" from SMF_LOG_DEBUG to
	SMF_LOG_INFO so that there is one searchable string in the
	mail log that always returns the milter's reply, which is
	typically a temporary or permanent reject, but could be a
	success result too. This can then be used for per-milter
	statistics and graphing. Requested by Jeff Powell.

   !	TextC.c: Break out some of the more commonly used functions
	and cover functions into separate source files. Also most of
	the in-place string functions have dropped the offset arguement.

  !!	Properties.c: The base-64 buffer length was being given as 2
	bytes too long, the length of "*?" base-64 lead-in, to the
	Base64DecodeBuffer routine, which could result in a corrupted
	input by PropertiesLoad(). Also made sure to reset the decode
	buffer between uses. This also affects loading of Cache
	flatfiles.

   +	siq.[ch]. Added SIQ query code as a library function.

   +	Added DnsSetNameServers().

   !	Changed DnsOpen(char **) to DnsOpen(void).

   +	spf.[ch]: Added SPF query function. Incomplete.

--1.45--

   -	smdb.c, smf.c: Removed smdReload() function.

   !	smdb.c: Modified smdbGetValue() to use flock() for controlled
   	access to sendmail database files. newaliases and makemap also
   	use flock().

   !	smdb routinues now have a mutex per smdb structure.

   !	Dns.c: hasInput() when using poll(): changed POLLHUP condition
	to return EPIPE only once all input has been exhausted.

  !!	License change to allow for private individual/single machine
  	license.

--1.44--

   !	aclocal.m4: fix Debian apt-get handling for Berkeley DB
	developmemt. After the apt-get, must redo the tests to find
	the headers.

   !	zoned.c: fixed authentication when not using PAM, as previously
   	done for filed.c

--1.43--

   !	Dns.c: fix logic bug that would cause some invalid "DNS
   	circular reference" errors.

   !	Dns.c: fix circular/bogus reference issue; SOA is returned for
	a request and the lookup of the A record of primary NS returns
	SOA again.

   !	Dns.c: failed to correctly handle cases where a lookup of
	something other than an SOA returned the SOA.

--1.42--

   +	Added VectorAll(), VectorSome(), HashAll(), HashSome() methods.

   !	Changed VectorWalk() behaviour to to pass the Vector to the
   	walk function.

   !	Socket.c: fixed sigwait() function signature issues for:
   	SunOS sbox 5.9 Generic_118558-05 sun4u sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-480R

   !	version.h.in.in: When an old version of libmilter.h is found
	without the newer handlers, then SET_SMFI_VERSION was left
	undefined, yet expected in smf.c.

   !	aclocal.m4, version.h.in.in, Socket.h: added tests for struct
   	sockaddr_un.

   !	aclocal.m4: fix typo for apt-get command (libc6-dev).

   !	aclocal.m4: SNERT_PTHREAD must detect and link with -lpthread
	for SunOS. The AC_SEARCH_LIBS macro found a stub elsewhere and
	thus never checked the remaining library list. Replace
	AC_SEARCH_LIBS with AC_CHECK_LIB which does an explicit test.

   +	smfMainStart(): detect when the .pid references a non-existant
   	process and overwrite it. An old .pid file could be left behind
   	if the milter crashes or is forcefully killed.

--1.41--

   !	Cache.c: Fixed preprocessor macros to properly exclude all
   	Berkeley DB for versions prior to 3.2.

   !	Cache.c: fixed segfault with db->verify() caused when there
   	is no previously existing cache.db. Reported by Oliver Falk.

   !	Fixed configure.in, aclocal.m4 script to better handle
	Berkeley DB library and header searches. All these cases
	should now work.

   		./configure
   		./configure --with-db
   		./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.2
   		./configure --without-db

   	LibSnert checks for and has been tested in the past with db
	4.2, 4.1, 3.3, 3.2, and 1.85. It will select the headers of
	the --with-db directory or the most current version found. It
	will note the presence of db4/db.h, db3/db.h, and/or db.h
	headers in com/snert/lib/version.h.

   +	configure.in: When building on Debian, will install libmilter-dev
   	if the headers are not found. Will also install the matching
   	Berkeley DB headers and pam headers.

   !	configure.in now has an option `--enable-cache-with-db-185' to
	allow the cache to support BDB 1.85 for any brave souls that
	want to try and see why the cache gets corrupted on *BSD.

   !	smfMainStart(): removed the masking of SIGQUIT, because
   	pthread_sigmask() affects *the current thread* in addition to
   	future threads, which would mean that SIGQUIT would never get
   	delivered to a milter. Doh! Reported by Mike Boev.

   !	counter.c, sendform.c: fixed -v, nph, and cgi handling.

   +	Added smfHeaderRemove().

   !	Cleaned up mailout.c to use syslog when on unix. Added more
   	error checking. Altered -f option behaviour. Added -t option.
   	The default sender address is now the DSN null address.

   !	Renamed mailout.c to smtpout.c.

   +	Added popin.c to read from POP mail accounts.

   +	configure.in, version.h.in.in: Check for sysexits.h.

   +	version.h.in.in: added my own EXIT_* codes, since sysexits.h is
   	not available for non-Unix like systems and I wanted error codes
   	I know would remain constant in all my code.

   !	smfAccessMail() and smfAccessRcpt() now explicitly clear the
   	skipMessage flag for REJECT/ERROR/HATER values. Use SKIP to
   	obtain the previous behaviour of a lookup short-circuit.

   	This issue was raised based on a question from Anke Breeuwsma,
   	where you white-list based on a connect: tag, but want to
   	override later based on from: or to: tag variants.

   !	Simplified configure.in and */makefile.in to avoid using xargs
   	for building the libsnert.a.

   !	Socket.c: Fixed a timeout bug with select() for Linux systems
	that modify the timeout structure:

		On Linux, the function select modifies timeout to
		reflect the amount of time not slept; most other
		implementations do not do this.  This causes problems
		both  when  Linux code which reads timeout is ported
		to other operating systems, and when code is  ported
		to  Linux  that  reuses  a struct  timeval  for
		multiple selects in a loop without reinitializing it.
		Consider timeout to be undefined after select returns.

   !	configure.in, version.h.in.in: Fixed detection and handling of
	flock() constants for some systems like Solaris 2.5.1 that
	talk about the constants in the flock man page, but fail to
	declare them in any headers. Reported by Stephen Carr.

   +	MailSpan.c: added functions MailSpanPath(), MailSpanAtDomainList(),
   	MailSpanMailbox(), and MailSpanIPv6().

   !	parsePath(): updated to recognise source routed addresses, IPv6
	address literals, and to perform regression testing.

   !	Cache.c: remove BDB 3.2+ restriction in the version testing
	macros in order to be sure that DBTXN is defined. Reported by
	Vittorio Moccia.

   !	counter.c: more usage text.

   +	smf.c: add smfMultiLineReply(), smfMultiLineReplyV(), and
	smfMultiLineReplyA() support. This requires Sendmail / libmilter
	8.13+ with smfi_setmlreply().

   +	Added mimepart.c to extract top level MIME body parts.

   +	smfAccessHost(), smfAccessMail(), smfAccessRcpt(): Added test
	for reserved RFC 2606 domains in MAIL or RCPT address.
	Suggested by Andrey Chernov.

   -	configure.in: Removed gcc option -fvolatile, which is no longer
   	supported in as of gcc 3.4.

   !	util/Properties.c, util/Cache.c: Fixed PropertiesSave() and
	PropertiesLoad() to create/open and lock the file until its
	closed by the routine. Previously the lock was released
	possibly too soon and the file closed elsewhere, such that
	another thread or process could begin to modify the file
	before the fclose() and result in a corrupted flat file.

   +	Added mail/smtp.c, which provides a set of routines for sending
	a message via SMTP. Similar to PHP's mail() function.

   +	parsePath(): Added flag argument to enable/disable strict
   	syntax and component length tests.

   !	Changed the smfInfo structure. The stateDir member has been
   	replaced by pid and workdir members.

   +	Added smfSetFileOwner(), smfStartBackgroundProcess(),
   	smfKillProcess(), smfOptions().

   !	Cache.c: flatfile type will immediately create an empty file
   	if the cache does not exist.

   !	Renamed TextToken() to TokenNext() and placed in its own file.

   +	Added util/Token.h, TokenCount(), TokenSplit(), and TokenSplitA().

   +	io/flock.c: added support for mingw file locking.

   !	io/Log.c: Changed function signatures for most Log*()
	functions. Changed behaviour of LogError(). LogError() no
	longer writes to both the log file and standard error, only
	the log file now. Use LogStderr() instead. Added LogPrintV()
	to write to the log file without writing a newline.

   +	SocketWriteIP: Block and discard SIGPIPE, particularly
	important in a threaded application.

   +	SockerWriteIP: Handle EAGAIN when using non-blocking write.

   !	smdbAccessCode() now tests the RHS value (OK, REJECT, ...) in
	a case-insensitive manner.

   !	smfMainStart(): ensures that a previous instance of the
	milter's .pid file does not already exist.

   !	Changed smfMainStart() function signature. The smfiDesc is now
	a member of the smfInfo structure.

   +	formatPath(): added %S and %T formats for source-route
	elements of a path.

   +	parsePath.c: Added formatPathLength() and allocatePath().

   !	Fix bug in formatPath() when formatting a buffer that is
	exactly the required length including space for the null byte.
	Even though space for the null byte was accounted for, the
	formatted string was short by one byte.

   !	strlcpy() is used when availble in place of TextCopy()

   +	parsePath.[ch]: Added isReservedIPv6(), isReservedIP(),
	parseIPv6(), and formatIP() functions.

   !	type/Hash.c: fix seg. fault in HashRemoveAll() code.

   +	Added smfSetFlags() and smfFlags to control some library
	internals.

   +	Added smfLog() to simplify common expressions.

   !	Moved the smdbReload() check from smfAccessHost() to
   	smfOpenProlog(), because smfAccessHost() may not be called
   	by some milters.

   !	tools/filed.c, tools/zoned.c now supports password checking
	using crypt() when there is no PAM library.

   !	configure.in: Replaced APR_CHECK_FILE by AC_CHECK_FILE. The
	Apache version using m4's translit() on cygwin deleted the
	letter 'r'.

   !	aclocal.m4 to detect libmilter extension handlers and modified
   	smf.* to enable xxfi_unknown and xxfi_data handles when supported
   	by the installed version of libmilter.

   +	Added SMF_FLAG_REJECT_PERCENT_HACK and test to smfAccessRcpt().

   +	Added code to smfMainStart() to detect the libmilter version at
   	runtime and set the milter's smfiDesc to match.

  !!	Complete rewrite of the DNS client code to support IPv6 and
	other DNS types of lookups: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SOA,
	and TXT. Also detects circular references. Impacts Socket.c,
	smtp.c, milter-sender, milter-siq.

  !!	Updated LICENSE.TXT.

--1.40--

   !	Fixed those tools that used LogOpen() to handle the new return
	code.

   !	Cache.c: Disable Berkeley DB support when BDB 1.85 is the only
	version available. Default becomes "flatfile".

   !	Base64DecodeBuffer() now allcoates an extra octet for the
	buffer and null terminates the end of the buffer just in case
	its a C string.

   !	counter.c, sendform.c: fixed handling of HTTP response line.

   +	Added tools/where-are-you.c and tools/here-i-am.c. These are a
	client/server that use broadcast messages on the local subnet
	to find the here-i-am server on a particular port.

   	For example setup an intranet web application on TCP port
	8008, set here-i-am as a server on UDP 8008 on the same
	machine, then the where-are-you client can broadcast from
	other workstations to port 8008 to discover the IP of the
	server. The idea here, is that an intranet client application
	could discover the intranet server and configure itself.

   !	smdb.c: minor optimisations.

   !	Fixed memory leaks in CacheBdbGet() and CacheBdbWalk() code
	when using BDB 3.2 or better.

   !	Renamed DataInitFromBytes() -> DataInitWithBytes() to remain
	consistent with my naming/action conventions. A *FromType is a
	copy from source and a *WithType is an assignment and/or
	passing of responsiblity of source.

--1.39--

   !	Cache.c: Fixed bug in CacheBdbGet() saving the wrong DBT
   	member for the Data length.

   !	Cache.c: Fixed null pointer reference for cache->get when
   	using flatfile or hash types and no entry is found.

   +	Cache.c: Added more cache debug code.

   +	smfMainStart(): now masks SIGQUIT from other threads.

   +	smfInfo, smfMainStart(): now can choose to close, leave as is,
   	or ignore standard I/O. Suggested by someone.

   +	Data.[ch]: Added DataCreateWithBytes().

   +	Base64.[ch]: Added new utility object type to encode/decode
   	base 64 strings.

   +	Properties.c now supports the saving and loading of binary key
   	and/or value encoded as a modified Base64 string.

   +	Added objectSize and objectMethodCount to all object-oriented
	types. The objectSize is the first member of any object and is
	equivalent of the sizeof the object. objectMethodCount is the
	number of method pointers following the objectName and before
	any instance data.

   +	smf.[ch]: Added smfSetProcessOwner(), which can be called
	before smfMainStart() so that files opened by the process have
	the correct ownership.

   !	smfMainStart() will still call smfSetProcessOwner() if the
	process is still owned by root at that point.

   !	Fixed the configuration file to recognise OpenBSD. Reported by
	Francisco of Blackant dot Net.

   -	Log.[ch]: dropped LOG_RAW, it was an idea that was never used.

   !	Log.h: changed for better portability with syslog.h when
	moving between Windows and Unix.

   !	LogV(): switch to binary mode output when compiling with
	Borland C.

   !	LogOpen() changed return code from 0/1 to -1/0.

   !	uriDecode(): fixed.

   +	counter.c, sendform.c: basic CGIs for Unix/Windows

   *	Note to self about installs on Debian: First find the matching
   	"libdbN.N-del" development package for the runtime library:

		apt-cache search berkeley
		apt-cache search milter

	Then install. For example:

		apt-get install libdb4.2-dev
		apt-get install libmilter-dev

--1.38--

   +	Bumped version to clearly indicate a new version after some
	people got hold of pre-release work in progress.

--1.37--

   +	smf.[ch]: Added some of the more commonly used Sendmail macro
	string constants.

   + 	When --disable-debug is set, #define NDEBUG now, which removes
	lots of syslog code. Requested by Alex Tkachenko. I've agreed
	to this for consistency with how --disable-debug is used in
	the milters. I may at somepoint remove many #ifndef NDEBUG
	wrappers in order to always keep some specific syslog code.

   !	Cache.c, smdb.h, configure.in: Fix inclusion of correct db.h
   	header.

   +	setBitWord.[ch] function added.

   !	smfSetLogDetail() now returns void and uses setBitWord().

   !	smfNullWorkspaceError() now returns SMFIS_ACCEPT as it use
   	to prior to 1.36.

   !	smfAccessHost() should always perform smdbReload() of the access
   	database.

   +	Add mutex wrapper in smdbClose().

   !	smdb.[ch]: Completely revamped the API once more.

   !	Socket.c: Only call shutdown() once for a given SHUT_ constant.

--1.36--

   !	I finally understand how the access database SKIP value is
	intended to be used. smdb.c routines now apply it as intended,
	which is that SKIP short circuits a subnet/subdomain search.
	So using the example given by sendmail:

		Connect:128.32                  RELAY
		Connect:128.32.2                SKIP

	Relay for all of 128.32.0.0/16 except 128.32.2.0/8, which
	skips the search without making a reject or accept decision.

	So now smdbIsAccessOk() will return SMDB_ACCESS_UNKNOWN
	instead of SMDB_ACCESS_OK for SMDB_ACCESS_SKIP.

   +	Socket.[ch]: add extra debug level SOCKET_DEBUG_FD for just
   	tracking file descriptors opened and closed.

   +	smdbAccessGetTagIp() add test for ':' in an IPv6 address (not
   	tested) when searching for subnets.

   +	mail/smf.c added to generalise a lot of common milter code I use.

--1.35--

   !	smdb.c: parseCfAccessFile() fixed double free bug (found using
   	FreeBSD MALLOC_OPTIONS enviroment variable). realloc()ing a word
   	and then using VectorSet(), which releases the old object caused
   	this.

   !	smdbAccessGetValue() neglected to add a terminating null byte to
   	the value.

   !	smdbAccessGetCode() reimplemented to use smdbAccessGetValue().

   !	Added mutex protection to smdbAccessGetValue(). Berkeley DB 1.85,
   	which is annoyingly still used by FreeBSD and friends, manages
   	the memory passed back through DBT by db->get. This is NOT thread
   	safe. Also in Berkeley DB 2 or better, the DB handle is only
   	thread safe if DB_THREAD is used, which I don't in favour of
   	using my own mutex here.


--1.34--

   !	Modified smdbReload() and smdbReopen() to treat the smdb
	argument as a volatile pointer to a volatile structure.

   !	Replaced the struct stat finfo member with just the mtime that
	we're really interested in.

   !	Modified pthread_mutex_* cover functions in Mutex.c to apply
	"volatile" semantics through the pthread_mutex_t *.

   !	Hell, just switch to using with gcc.

   !	Dns.c: Replaced 127.0.0.1 with 0.0.0.0 for "this host". This
	resolves some problems discovered with jailed FreeBSD virtual
	machines found in some colocation services. Reported by Volker
	Stolz.

   !	SocketAddressToIP() converts a NULL string into 0.0.0.0.

   +	smdb.c: Added stub functions for when LIBSNERT_WITH_BERKELEY_DB
   	is not defined.

   +	Added smdbAccessIsOk() to generalise the SMDB_ACCESS_* codes.
   	Note that SMDB_ACCESS_DISCARD is generalised as SMDB_ACCESS_OK.

   !	smdb.[ch]: Replaced smdbAccessGet*Access() by smdbAccessGetTag*()
   	which now return a specific SMDB_ACCESS_* code.

   +	smdb.[ch]: smdbAccessGet{Ip|Domain|EmailDomainUser}(), which
	are similar to smdbAccessIs{Ip|Domain|EmailDomainUser}Ok(),
	but return a specific SMDB_ACCESS_* code. So for example:

   		smdbAccessIsIpOk() = smdbAccessIsOk(smdbAccessGetIp());

   !	Replaced // comments in Cache.c and Luhn.c with /* .. */
	Reported by Willi Burmeister

   !	smdbReopen(): Changed goto point when db->verify() fails.

   !	smdb.h: fixed header include order and structure declarations
   	when Berkeley DB is NOT found.

   !	parsePath.h: renamed "Text" structure used by ParsePath to
	"string" to avoid namespace collisions with lib/type/Text.h
	object.

   +	Added range to tools to display a range of numbers.

   +	Added grouplist to tools to display members of a group.

   +	Added mailgroup to tools to mail to all members of a group.

   +	Added the inetd server "filed" a version or two ago.

   +	Added the inetd server "zoned" a version or two ago.

   !	Dns.c: FreeBSD jailed machines have problems with UDP sockets
	for some stupid reason. Once a socket sends a packet to a
	host, the UDP socket locks in on that address, which is not
	suppose to happen with UDP sockets. The work around is
	open/close the socket for each DNS query packet (ugly but it
	works). Reported by Volker Stolz.
	http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=kern/26506

   +	smdb.[ch]: added

   		smdbAccessGetValue()
   		smdbAccessGetValueTagDomain()
   		smdbAccessGetValueTagEmailDomainUser()

   +	Begin annotating and `splint' checking the source code. The
   	subdirectories crc, mail, and type have been done.


--1.33--

   !	TextCopy() reimplemented to be like BSD's strlcpy().

   -	TextCopyN() dropped in favour of redefined TextCopy().

   !	TextInputLine(), TextReadLine() now takes long size and
	returns a long length instead of int.

   !	Dns.c: readResolvConf(): If there are no nameserver entries or
	the /etc/resolv.conf can't be found or opened, then the
	default is to use the local machine. Reported by Andrey
	Chernov.

   +	configure.in, version.h.in: added missing tests for inet_pton.

   !	Log.[ch]: Renamed openlog() used for Window or Cygwin to be
	LogOpenLog(), with macro replacements for syslog functions.
	This allows for:

   		#define WITHOUT_SYSLOG
   		#include <com/snert/lib/io/Log.h>

   	to override syslog. WITHOUT_SYSLOG is assumed for Windows.

   !	DebugMalloc.c now uses pthread_mutex_* routines or Windows
	mutex routines instead of Mutex.

   +	Implemented some object oriented like data types:

   		type/Object
   		type/Data
   		type/Decimal
   		type/Hash
   		type/Integer
   		type/Text
   		type/Vector
   		util/Properties

   	The type/Hash replaces util/Hashtable. The type/Vector
	replaces util/Vector. Updated those file that used Vector
	or Hashtable.

	The type/Text and util/Text both have a similar set of
	functions, but a disjoint set of function names so that both
	can be used at the same time. Eventually util/Text will go
	away.

   +	Added:

   		util/Cache

	The util/Cache provides a front end to some persistent data
	store like Berkeley DB or a flat file, or non-persistent Hash.
	This can be extended latter to use other database types.

	This will replace my cache support in milter-sender and be
	used in some other milter projects needing a cache.

   +	BufAddInputLine() and BufAddReadLine() will now correctly
	return a positive value when data has been read and the EOF is
	seen before a newline

   +	Add some cover functions for pthread_mutex_* functions for
	systems without the pthread_mutex_* api, eg. Windows.

   !	../tools/show.c: switched to buffered I/O as default and added
   	-u option for unbuffered output.

   !	Thread.c: resolved compiler warnings for POSIX code. All should
   	work now except ThreadWaitOn().

   !	Socket.[hc]: Replaced occurence of socklen_t with size_t, since
   	it appears to have some wierd problem on some Solaris boxen,
   	probably a header mix up.

   +	Add smdbAccessGetCode() to return the exact code from the access
   	database. smdbAccessGetAcces() returned a generic code, which may
   	not be suitable for specialised tests.

--1.32--

   +	smdbAccessGetDomainAccess() makes sure that the lookup key is
   	lower case. Reported by Mark Frey.

   !	BufFromBytes() forgot to add the extra nul sentinel byte for
	use with C string functions. See BufAddByte() for commentary.


--1.31--

   +	smdbReopen() now close and reopens the database handle after the
   	db->verify() for older versions of Berkeley DB. For Berkeley DB
   	4.2.52, we can't even do a DB->close() on the handle:

		The DB handle may not be accessed again after
		DB->verify is called, regardless of its return.

   +	TextSensitiveFind(), TextInsensitiveFind() added.

   +	Socket.c: fixed references to PF_INET6 to be conditionally compiled.

   !	configure.in: on Solaris fix search for library containing inet_ntoa()
   	and/or inet_ntop(). Also library containing sem_init() for POSIX
   	semaphores.

   !	configure.in: fix inclusion of -lpthread for Solaris machines.
	Appears that there is a stub in the standard library that
	confuses the configure script into thinking it has the correct
	library already in its list.

   !	Mutex.c: Fixed sem_init() bug for POSIX semaphores; doesn't
	anyone choose to use POSIX by choice?

   +	../tools/show.c now supports -f option and -p to highlight patterns.

   -	Dropped ../tools/CHANGES-TOOLS.TXT. since its too much hassle to
	keep updated and in-sync with CHANGES-LIBSNERT.TXT.  All tool
	changes will be documented here from now on, since the tools are
	always bundled with LibSnert.

   !	smdb.[ch]: replaced keyBuffer member which was not thread safe.

   !	Changed the type of function passed to VectorOnRemove() to be
   	a simple destructor, like "void free(void *)".

   !	Changed VectorCreate() to take a second parameter that sets the
   	onRemove function.


--1.30--

   !	smdb.c: Renamed LINE_SIZE to SMCF_LINE_SIZE to avoid possible name
   	conflicts within other system headers.

   !	Duplicate code for SocketWaitForInput() and SocketWaitForOutput()
   	now merged into an internal function SocketWait().

   !	Merged SOCKET_DEBUG_READ and SOCKET_DEBUG_WRITE into
   	SOCKET_DEBUG_READ_WRITE. Merged SOCKET_DEBUG_GET and SOCKET_DEBUG_SET
   	into SOCKET_DEBUG_GET_SET.

   +	Add debug log line to SocketGetError().

   !	Renamed HAVE_BERKELEY_DB to LIBSNERT_WITH_BERKELEY_DB to avoid future
   	name space collisions.

   !	Error.c, tools/flip.c: Fix FatalPrintLineV() to use ErrorPrintLineV()
   	to avoid the need to use a (va_list) 0  cast which assumes a pointer.
   	Patch given by Volker Stolz.

   +	Added new argument to TextToken() and TextSplit() that allows empty
   	tokens to be returned. So for example:

		TextSplit("name=", "=", 0)	returns Vector of length 1
   		TextSplit("name=", "=", 1)	returns Vector of length 2
   		TextSplit("a,,c", ",", 0)	returns Vector of length 2
   		TextSplit("a,,c", ",", 1)	returns Vector of length 3

   +	Dns.c: getRecord() saves a copy of the IP address as a C string.

   !	Dns.c: getRecordList() when resolving an answer against the extra
   	records now assigns both the IP address value and its C string version
   	to the answer record.

   !	DnsTest.c: changed inet_ntoa(host->ip) to host->value.

   +	Dns.c: Now supports /etc/resolv.conf for list of nameservers. Use
   	DnsInit() at start of application to load the list. If the list
   	changes, the application has to be restarted.

   !	DnsTest.c: The list of DNS servers is now optional, in which case
   	the list given by /etc/resolv.conf is used.

   !	DnsOpen() can be passed NULL to use the system name server list.

   !	SocketAddressToIp() rewritten to use DnsGetAddresses() instead
	of using gethostbyname() and gethostbyname_r() code. The
	former is not thread safe and the latter appears to crash
	threaded processes on old Linux kernels or glibc libraries (at
	least that's what is alluded to after googling for bug
	reports). The problem with gethostbyname_r() may be the cause
	of obscure crashes seen with milter-sender.

   !	DnsOpen(), DnsClose(), sendQuery(), SocketOpen*() functions
	changed to work around a chicken-n-egg problem as a result of
	SocketAddressToIp() changes.

   -	configure.in: Commented out the tests for gethostbyname() and
   	gethostbyname_r() as they are no longer used in LibSnert.

   +	smdb.c: Add parsing support for $M (Masquerade As) macro. Sets
   	global C string smMasqueradeAs if defined.

   +	smdb.c: Add parsing support for ClientPortOptions option. Sets
   	two global structures, smClientPortInet4 and/or smClientPortInet6.

   +	readSendmailCf() and smMasqueradeAs are always available regardless
   	whether LIBSNERT_WITH_BERKELEY_DB is defined or not.

   !	MailSpanAddressLiteral() returns 0 if the trailing ']' is missing.

   !	Changed MailSpan*() arguments from char * to const char *.

   !	parsePath(): The ParsePath address member now contains the original
   	address as found in the path argument. That is to say, there is no
   	case folding done on the address. Note however that there the other
   	structure members are folded to lower case.

   -	Removed "plus" member from ParsePath structure that did not appear
   	to be used.

   !	smdb.c: Fixed compiler warnings with FreeBSD with Berkeley DB 1.85.

   !	smdbAccessGetAccess(): under FreeBSD with Berkeley DB 1.85, a
	seg.fault could occur some times when attempting to log the
	leading part of value.data. Moved the debug code after just
	after copying of the leading value to the work buffer, which
	is forced to be null terminated and safe to print.

   !	Text*With() family of functions now return -1 for no match, or the
   	length of prefix/suffix that matched. This allows for the empty
   	(zero length) string to be matched.

   !	Fixed configure.in detection of gethostbyname() and co. for Solaris.

   +	Mutex.c: SYSTEMV_API code section now saves the semaphore ID to the
	lockfile. The value saved here can then be used to release a leaked
	semaphore in the event of a crash. POSIX_API creates an empty lockfile
	for the moment so that its existance can be detected else where; not
	sure if anything useful can be recorded for POSIX_API.

   +	tools/strings.c: a basic version of strings for machines without one.

   !	readSendmailCf() takes an extra argument to control which sendmail
   	databases to open.

--1.29--

   +	Added MutexPreRelease() to hide the Unix trick of pre-releasing
	mutexes (like temp. file handles) that they can continue to use
	until the process terminates. This resolves semaphore leakage on
	some platforms with respect to my milters that are not shutdown in a
	the normal clean manner, because Sendmail takes control of the
	signals INT, TERM, HUP, and QUIT to provide a delayed shutdown
	sequence, which is far too long.

   !	Rename EmailSpan* to MailSpan*. Moved files into new subdirectory.
   	com/snert/src/lib/mail.

   +	Added parsePath.[ch] files from milters to com/snert/src/lib/mail.

   !	MailSpanLocalPart() now will validate quoted string for the
   	local-part part as given by RFC 2821. Before it only validated
   	a dot-string.

   +	addTimeStamp() renamed to TimeStampAdd() and moved to Time.c from
   	milters.

   +	Moved getIp4Octets(), ip4ToString(), and inet_top() cover function
   	from milters to	Socket.c.

   +	Move smdb.c from milters to com/snert/src/lib/mail. Created smdb.h.

   !	getopt() now returns an error if GNU-style long options are passed,
   	instead of end of argument list. Reported by Torsten Neuer.

   !	SocketOpenTcpClient(): resolve possible side-effects issue with
   	syslog() calls refering to SocketGetError() during debugging, but
   	not in some error test code. Reported by Torsten Neuer.

   !	Fixed a problem with EAGAIN/EINTR handling, in particular withn
   	SocketReadLine(), not calling SocketClearError() before	resuming an
   	interrupted operation. SocketReadLine() would complete reading a line,
   	but the caller would then check SocketGetError() and misreport an
   	interruption ("Interrupted system call (4)" messages for example) that
   	had been dealt with. Discovered by Jan Holmberg.


--1.28--

   !	Define socklen_t for SunOs 5.6-i386. Reported by Jorge Valdes.

   +	Added BufInsertBytes().


--1.27--

   !	SocketWaitForInput(), SocketRead(): fixed to support buffered
   	input. The support for buffered non-blocking input implemented
   	for SocketReadLine() in 1.24 neglected to inform these other
   	two functions that things were a little different. Reported by
   	Igor R.Babkin.

--1.26--

   !	Socket.c: It appears that SOL_TCP is not defined universally.
	Replaced SOL_TCP with IPPROTO_TCP. Reported by Claudio
	Eichenberger

--1.25--

   !	Socket.c: Fix portability issues with Alex Vasylenko's Unix
   	domain socket patch, that use PF_LOCAL, AF_LOCAL, and SUN_LEN
   	macros instead of PF_UNIX, AF_UNIX, and sizeof. Reported by
   	Chris M. Miller.

   !	Socket.[ch]: Created InetAddress object. Modified Socket
	functions to use this object. Made SocketWriteIp() public and
	intended for writing UDP packets to different InetAddresses.

   !	Several fixes for Unix domain sockets that were missed by the
   	original patch from Alex Vasylenko: SocketAccept() client socket
   	and SocketRead() recv member have to be setup properly.

   !	Dns.c now open uses only one UDP socket to query each DNS server,
   	instead of the one per server.

--1.24--

   !	version.h.in: Added missing HAVE_INET_* defines, in particular
   	HAVE_INET_NTOP, used by milter-*.  Reported by Andrey Chernov.

   !	SocketGetError(): only set the Socket error value if the call
   	to getsockopt() succeeds, otherwise the so_error is unreliable.
   	Reported by Jan Holmberg.

   !	Text.h: fixed prototypes for TextToLower() and TextToUpper()
   	to be TextLower() and TextUpper() as they appear in Text.c.

   +	Added TextCopy(), which copies one string to another limiting
   	the length copied based on which is shorter the shortest between
   	the two strings.

   !	configure.in: replace sem_init search with pthread_create search.

   +	configure.in: Added use of -Wall with GCC everywhere possible.

   +	Dns.c: getRecordList() added check for null DnsRecord in parse
   	loop.

   +	Added Unix domain socket support to Socket.c Patch provided by
   	Alex Vasylenko. Useful for milter-spamc, see -H option.

   +	Added TextSubstring().

   !	SocketClose() will now only perform a clean shutdown if there
	were no errors of any sort.

   !	SocketReadLine() re-implemented to allow for more efficient reads
   	when in non-blocking mode, which is now preferred.

--1.23--

   !	configure.in: simplified and reduced library searches so as to
   	only specify those libraries we really need.

   !	Added null guard to TextSplit() when it creates the vector.

   !	MemoryFree() now returns 0 on success and -1 for a memory
   	consistency check error. Tests for already freed chunks.

   !	MemoryCreate() will now call malloc() to allocate the large
   	block to partition, if the block argument is null.

   +	DebugMalloc() added that uses Memory*() functions as a malloc
   	library replacement for debugging purposes. When built with
   	_REENTRANT, then a mutex is used to protect threaded processes.
   	These routines are NOT part of libsnert.a and must explicitly
   	linked when needed.

   +	VectorCreate() will default to an initial capacity of 1 when
   	zero or less is specified.

   !	MemoryAllocate(): fix bug in best-fit loop. This does not
	affect any of the milters, but does affect mod_watch and
	mod_require_host, which use a copy of this module.

   +	MemoryAllocate() and MemoryFree() now set errno for EINVAL,
   	ENOMEM, and EFAULT (consistency error).

   +	Memory.c enhanced to detect overflow conditions.


--1.22--

   +	Add -pthread to CFLAGS. Ensure that LibSnert is built ready
   	for threads, especially for milters.

--1.21--

   +	Added TextReverse() and TextInvert().

   +	Added Luhn.c and Luhn.h to validate and generate Luhn
	checksums. Ported from my Java, JavaScript, and PHP code.

   !	Added fix for SunOS / Solaris gethostbyname_r() that returns
   	a pointer instead of an int. Reported by Roland Kaltefleiter.

   !	Change last argument type for ErrorPrintV(),
	ErrorPrintLineV(), FatalPrintV(), FatalPrintLineV(), LogVLog),
	and StderrV() from a void * to va_list. While void * and
	va_list might be equivalent in size some compilers for RH 7.2
	Alpha report errors for strange type conversions. Essentially
	I was being too clever for my own good, think it would help
	portability.

   !	configure.in: Added test for inet_aton() in libresolv for
   	SunOS 5.8, required by libmilter and socket applications.

--1.20--

   +	More debug information in SocketOpenTcpClientWait().

   !	SocketOpenTcpClient() now tests for EINTR after connect().

   !	SocketWaitForInput() and SocketWaitForOutput() now test for
	EINTR after select().

   !	Modified SocketRead() log message to report the last byte read.

   !	SocketReadLine() now checks for EINTR and EAGAIN after
	SocketRead(). In particular EAGAIN would be returned half way
	through reading the welcome message from btconnect.com. Reported
	by Richard at noc dot moose dot co dot uk.

   !	SocketSetNonBlocking() fix bug that failed to correctly restore
   	a non-blocking socket to a blocking one.

   +	Support for GNU autoconf 2.57 implemented.  No more *.mk files!
   	Just ./configure. The ../mk directory and the old makefile files
   	will be removed at a later date.

   	Note that while I have figured out how to create a configure
   	script with autoconf, my source does not yet take advantage of
   	all the tests out side of the ones I wrote for the time, mutex,
   	and shared memory API

   +	Added ../tools to the build process. Moved all the Windows-only
   	stuff to another project and kept the portable stuff that builds
   	on multiple platforms.

   !	Assorted minor changes for autoconf to *.c files.

   !	Modified makefile.in files to use old-style implicit rules, since
   	some servers have only an old make command or a make other than
   	GNU make. (FreeBSD 4.8 hmmm)


--1.19--

   +	Fixed SocketReadLine() to detect and return an EOF condition
   	instead of an empty line result.

   +	Add logging debug code in SocketWaitForInput() and
   	SocketWaitForOutput().


--1.18--

   !	Socket.c: All the syslog debugging code is compiled in by default
   	now.  Can be disabled by defining NDEBUG at the top of the file.

   !	SocketOpenTcpClientWait(): After the connect() and the wait for
	writability, I failed to check the socket error value as
	outlined in the man page I had inserted as a comment - doh! So
	ECONNREFUSED would be return much later on the first socket
	read/write operation. Reported by Volker Stolz with regards to
	milter-sender.

   !	Socket.c: Fixed SocketGetAddress() and SocketGetSourceAddress()
   	to handle inet_ntop() or inet_ntoa(). Define HAS_INET_NTOP in
   	*.mk as required.

   +	Dns.c: sendQuery(): Added work around for FreeBSD sendto()
	returning EINVAL for UDP packets, when sendto() doesn't define
	EINVAL as a valid return code under FreeBSD. Reported by Volker
	Stolz. http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=26506

   +	Dns.c: Add DnsSetDebugMask() and lots of syslog() debugging
	throughout the DNS code in a similar manner to Socket.c. This
	code is on by default. Can be disabled by defining NDEBUG at the
	top of the file.

   !	Log.c: fix compiler warning about getpid().

   !	mkpath.c: fix compiler warning about mkdir().

   !	Buf.[ch]: Changed function signature of BufAddByte() to accept
   	an int instead of unsigned char.

   !	BufAddByte() fix compiler warning about losing significant digits.

   !	Text.c fix compiler warnings about losing significant digits.

   -	BuildId.h file removed and all reference to it removed from all
   	LibSnert headers. Fixes compiler warnings about LibSnert
   	structure pointer not being used.

   +	BuildId structure replaced by VersionInfo structure found in
   	com/snert/lib/version.h. This file contains LIBSNERT_ macros
   	defining version and copyright information. This file is
   	machine generated from version.master.h.

   !	Modified LibSnert.c for new VersionInfo structure. LibSnert
   	is now a structure instead of a pointer to a structure.

   +	Log.c: Added LogStderrV() and LogStderr().

   !	Log.c: existing Log() renamed LogV() and Log() created with
   	variable argument list. This allows for simple name replacement
   	of syslog() and vsyslog() under Windows.

   -	Log.c: Removed LogMessage(). Was not used.

--1.17--

   +	Add SocketShutdownNow() for use in milter-spamc. The SPAMC
   	protocol uses a shutdown() of the writing side to signal EOF
   	to SPAMD.

   +	BufAddByte(), BufAddBytes(), BufInputLine(), BufReadLine(), and
	BufSetLength(): For convenience make sure the buffer is always
	null terminated so that we can use BufBytes() to pass the buffer
	to C string functions. The null byte is not part of the data nor
	its length.


--1.16--

   !	MailSpanDomainName(): changed to validate both characters and
   	syntax of a domain name and allow for the minimum number of dots
   	to look for to be specified.


--1.15--

   !	SocketAddressToIP(): FreeBSD does not have gethostbyname_r(), but
   	does appear to have gethostbyname() in libc_r, which I'm assuming
   	is not thread safe given the info found here:

   		http://www.unobvious.com/bsd/freebsd-threads.html

   	To be on the safe side, SocketAddressToIP(), SocketOpenTcpClient(),
   	and SocketOpenTcpClientWait() should be wrapped with a mutex when
   	used within a threaded application, like milter-sender.

   !	SocketAddressToIp(): Modified gethostbyname_r() support to avoid
   	allocating a large buffer on the stack, which can blow up some
   	stacks. Instead malloc()/free() the buffer as needed.

   !	SocketAddressToIp(): test value of h_errno even if gethostbyname_r()
   	returns zero.

   !	Vector.c: It didn't make sense to pass a "void **" for the passed
   	in data pointer to an opaque object for walk and remove handlers.
   	Changed VectorWalkFunction and VectorRemoveFunction types and
   	supporting functions to pass just a "void *" instead. Impacts
	Dns.c, HashTable.c, Text.c, milter-sender.c

   !	Socket.c: More debug code. SocketSetDebugMask().

   !	SocketClose(): added test of sock->fd member before system call.

   !	SocketOpen(): modified error handling and return.

   !	SocketGetError() modified SocketGetError() to cache the socket
   	so_error result and added SocketClearError() to explicitly clear
   	the cached copied and errno. SocketClearError() is called by Socket*
   	functions prior to socket system calls.

   !	Add -D_REENTRANT to CFLAGS macro in all *.mk files. This library
   	has to be compiled with _REENTRANT to be thread-safe, especially with
   	regards to errno.

--1.14--

   +	Added SocketSetNonBlocking() since the use of SocketSetReadFlags()
   	and SocketSetWriteFlags() requires the inclusion of header files
   	for socket flags we're trying to hide behind a portability layer.

   !	Modified SocketOpenTcpClientWait() to use SocketSetNonBlocking().

   +	SocketOpenTcpClientWait(): After connect(), in test for EINPROGRESS,
   	must exclude errno = 0 from error condition, since it appears that
   	connect() can return non-zero and set errno = 0. Thank you Roland
   	Kaltefleiter.

   +	SocketAddressToIP(): Use of gethostbyname() is NOT thread safe.
   	Modified to use gethostbyname_r(), which has different function
   	signatures for Linux and Sun (grrr). Thank you Roland Kaltefleiter.

   !	Fix SNERT macro in all *.mk to reflect typical unpack location of
   	/usr/local/src, instead of personal development directory.

--1.13--

   !	Socket.c: Reading zero length bytes in SocketReadLine() should
	NOT be an error condition. Instead be sure to null terminate
	the line buffer on a zero length read and return the length of
	the line buffer. This allows the caller finer control in the
	case of a zero length or partial reads.

--1.12--

   !	Duh! Forgot to update the version number. Thanks Jeff Powell.

--1.11--

   !	Dns.c: RFC 974 "Issuing a Query" paragraph 4 concerning CNAME
   	when looking for MX records, now correctly supported. Example
   	of such a case is "omail.xowwc.com". Thanks to Ralf Fischer
	for reporting this.

   	Yes, I know I should have used libresolv, BUT that library does
   	not build under Windows using Borland C compiler.

   !	MailSpan.c: Added missing '/' character to accepted local part
   	character list in MailSpanLocalPart(). Thanks to Ralf Fischer
	for reporting this.

--1.10--

   !	Log.c: fix syslog()/vsyslog() cover functions to send newlines.

   !	Dns.[ch]: replaced internal routines getDnsHostList() and
	findHostEntry() with getRecordList() and getRecord() in order
	to simplify a complex loop and fixed a bug where a domain name
	actually doubles as a host name caused the RR parsing code to
	match the wrong RR returned in the result, eg. dig alrec.nl mx
	is a good example of what caused a problem. Thanks to Ralf Fischer
	for reporting this.

   !	Dns.[ch]: DnsHost and DnsHostRemoveEntry() renamed DnsRecord and
   	DnsRecordRemoveEntry() to reflect a more general purpose data
   	type for future use.

   !	DnsTest.c: Added null pointer guards for when the result vector
   	is null signifying no answer.

--1.9--

   !	Fixed mk/FreeBSD.mk and makefiles to support xargs -J instead of
   	-I for older versions of FreeBSD, like version 4.4.

   !	Dns.c: Clear packet buffer before SocketRead() in sendQuery().

   +	Dns.c: DnsGetNameServers() needed code similar to DnsGetMailServers()
   	to make sure that we actually got the IP addresses for an NS record.
   	findHostEntry() modified so that MX, NS, or CNAME can return the
   	server name without a matching A record.

   !	Dns.c: DnsGetNameServers() / DnsGetMailServers() - if a secondary
   	A record lookup fails for an entry, we remove the entry from the
   	result list.

   !	Dns.c: Fix memory leak in internal function findHostEntry() when an
   	MX is found AND the a matching A record is supplied, then the
   	entry->name allocated for the MX case would be overwritten with a
   	duplicate value for the A case.

   !	Vector.c: Fix bug in VectorRemove() not decrementing the vector length.

   !	Log.[hc]: Added LOG_FATAL and LogFatal(). Reports message to log file
   	and standard error then exits with exit code 9 (I choose this because
   	it matches "kill -9"). My view of exits code is rather loose, but for
   	years I have used the following: 0 normal (true), 1 error (false),
   	2 usage, and now 9 for fatal exit (don't ask me where abort() sits).

--1.8--

   +	Added mk/FreeBSD.mk. Renamed linux.mk and sunos-5.8.mk to Linux.mk
   	and SunOS-5.8.mk to correspond to their "uname -s" values.

   !	Replaces "xargs -i" in all makefiles with XARGSI macro. System V
   	and BSD likes systems differ on -i and -I support.

   !	makefile rules for crctable and DnsTest now explicitly state their
   	recipes, instead of inferring them.

   !	Remove redundant display of pid from syslog() statements. The will
   	be displayed if LOG_PID argument is passed to openlog().

--1.7--

   !	Dns.c: modified "domain name does not exist" error to "DNS name
   	not found" to reflect the more general error case were it might
   	not exist or just wasn't found quickly.

   !	Dns.[ch]: more null pointer guards.

   !	Socket.[ch]: Change SocketOpen() signature to pass the socket type
   	SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_STREAM instead of the protocol.

   !	Log.[ch]: Add LogMessage() to log a message without a log level.

   !	Log.[ch]: Export Log() now. Add cover functions for Unix syslog()
   	and vsyslog() for none unix environments for easy porting.

   +	Added and tested mk/sunos-5.8.mk.

   !	Socket.[ch]: Define INADDR_NONE when no definition found. Likewise
   	for SOL_TCP.

   !	Dns.c, DnsTest.c: Add more debugging code using Log file output. Can
   	be disabled by defining the macro NDEBUG. Really handy when there is
   	no debugger on the target machine.

   !	Dns.c: Added macros to access network short and long words at odd
   	memory addresses, which can cause a bus error on some CPU architectures
   	(Sun sparc for example).

   !	Dns.c: Fixed what looked to be a memory leak in findHostEntry() due to
   	bizarre complex loop code.

   !	Socket.[ch]: Changed internal SocketIP() to an exported SocketAddressToIP()
   	function, which can be used to hide portability issues between inet_addr()
   	vs. inet_aton().

   !	Dns.c: Changed DnsSetAttempts() to multiply the number of attempts by
   	the number of servers being consulted.  This means that sendQuery() will
   	cycle through ALL servers at most N times.

   !	Dns.c: The DNS server timeout uses an exponential backoff algorithm
   	divided by the number of servers.  However, for two or more servers
   	the first few attempts will have really short unreasonable timeouts,
   	so now we maintain a minimum specified by DNS_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT.

   !	Dns.c: Renamed getDomain() as getName() and rewrote a group of functions
   	related to resource record name parsing

--1.6--

   +	Socket.[ch]: Added SocketOpenTcpClientWait() and SocketWaitForOutput().

   !	Socket.c: fixed compile time warnings for Borland C.

--1.5--

   !	Dns.c: DnsGetMailServers() changed handling of MX lookup which
   	returns an empty list according to RFC 974. I was pretty close
   	before, but this corresponds more closely to the RFC.

   !	Socket.c: Made the use of inet_aton() the default instead of
   	inet_addr() SocketIP(). Use the macro USE_INET_ADDR to use the
   	older function (see ../mk/bcc.mk).

   +	Dns.c: Added null pointer guard to DnsClose().

   +	Vector.[ch]: implemented VectorWalk(), VectorWalkIgnore(),
   	VectorRemoveAbort(), VectorRemoveTrivial(), VectorOnRemove()
   	to be similar to HashTable. Prior to this there may have been
   	memory leaks with respect to TextSplit() when a returned
   	Vector was destroyed (similarly for HashTableDestroy()).

   -	Dns.[ch], Dnstest.c: Dropped DnsHostListFree() in favour of setting
   	a VectorOnRemove() function, DnsHostRemoveEntry(), for cleanup by
   	VectroyDestroy().

   +	Text.c: Specified VectorOnRemove() function for when vector is
   	destroyed.

   !	HashTable.[ch]: Altered function definition of HashTableOnRemove()
   	to use a HashTableRemoveFunction instead of HashTableWalkFunction
   	to reduce possible confusion. HashTableWalkAbort renamed to
   	HashTableRemoveAbort and added HashTableRemoveTrivial.

   +	LibSnert.c, BuildId.h: Added BuildId structure for version tracking.
   	Each object file will link in a pointer LibSnert to __LibSnert__ in
   	any executable using LibSnert functions.

   +	Text.[ch]: Added TextLower() and TextUpper()

--1.4--

   +	Clean up several compiler warnings for Cygwin:

	    crc/crctable.c: Add missing header for strerror().
	    util/Time.h: Add missing newline before EOF.
	    util/Buf.c: Add missing header for read().
	    io/Message.c: Alter header inclusion code.

   +	*/makefile: Changed the library build receipes from a shell
   	for-loop to use ls/xarg and force that the file objects be
   	added to the library. There are some (older?) Linux systems that
   	appear to have trouble with performing all the makefile actions
   	resulting in undefined references when linking an application.

   +	*/makefile: Added missing calls to "ranlib" required for some
   	platforms.

   +	Add more helpful commentary to the makefile for build and install.

--1.3--

   !	sys/mutex.c: Replace source with version from mod_watch to solve
   	union semun issues.

   !	Dns.[ch]: Add TTL field to DnsHost for applications that want to
   	provide some type of cache support.

   !	Dns.c: Add null pointer guard to DnsHostListFree().

   !	HashTable.[ch]: Added HashTableWalk(), HashTableOnNext(), and
   	changed HashTableGet(), HashTableSet(), HashTableRemove().

--1.2--

   +	MailSpan.c: Generalised email address validation code from
   	milter-sender.c for use by tools/mailout.c. Note that IPv6
   	validation not implemented and does not actually test syntax
   	(yet).

   +	io/posix.h: Add a header file to provide common definitions
   	for low-level POSIX I/O functions that are available with
   	Borland, but through non-standard headers.

   !	Socket.c: Fixed some Borland C 5.5 relate compiler errors and
   	warnings.

   !	LICENSE.TXT: Changed to further clarify terms and conditions.

   !	Dns.[ch]: Modified to support multiple DNS servers. Fixed
   	timeout handling to be more like ISC BIND (libresolv)
   	behaviour.

   !	Dns.c, DnsTest.c: buildQuery() now sets the default error message
   	to an empty string, instead of a null string pointer. I disliked
   	the idea that an error might occur and DnsSetError() might not
   	have been called to set the nature of the error. I'm pretty sure
   	all returns are accounted for with a DnsSetError(), but prefer
   	to protect myself against my future self not being so vigilant.
   	So use DnsGetReturnCode() to test for RCODE_OK instead of testing
   	for a null pointer from DnsGetError().

   !	DnsTest.c: Command line argument order changed to test the
   	Dns code using multiple DNS servers.

   !	Vector.c: Modified the code so that the array of pointers to
   	objects always has null pointer at the end. This allows
   	routines that use the result of VectorBase() to detect the end
   	of array easily.

   !	Dns.[ch]: Rewrote most of the response parsing code to better handle
   	{MX, NS} -> CNAME -> A lookups.

   !	Dns.c: Fix DnsGetMailServers() makes secondary A record queries
   	for an initial MX record request that failed to include them. It
   	will also handle the case where a misconfigured MX actually returns
   	an IPv4 address string instead of a domain name.

   +	Dns.[ch]: Started working on DnsDumpLast(), but its not finished.

--1.1--

   !	Dns.c: DnsHostListFree() & DnsHostFree() added null pointer
   	guards.

   !	Dns.c: Fix potential memory leak in DnsGetMailServers().

   +	Dns.c: Added DnsSetTimeout().

   +	Socket.c: Added SocketSetBroadcast(), SocketSetKeepAlive(),
   	SocketSetReuseAddr(), SocketGetError(), SocketSetShutdown(),
   	SocketSetLinger()

   !	Socket.c: SockwtReadLine() changed type of buffer size and
   	return type from int to long to match with SoscketRead(),

   +	Dns.c: query() disabled check for empty answer section, since
   	there may be other parts of the response of interest to the
   	caller.

   !	Socket.c: SocketOpen() added better handling of "shutdown".

   ~	I've been asked WHY bother writing my own Dns code, when there
   	already exists the Bind libraries: simple, they are a PAIN to
   	build for Windows or Cygwin. I tried and it wasn't at all clear
   	and I wanted something that would work under several platforms
   	easily. Added to the fact its been an interesting learning
   	experience.

   +	Text.c: Added TextCopyN().

   ~	NOTE that the Thread.c code is incomplete. The Windows code
   	should finished, but the Linux version not yet.

--1.0--

   +	First public release.
