SMTP Engine Call-Backs
----------------------

When smtpe first starts, it creates a master Lua state (interpreter) and
loads and executes ``/etc/smtpe.lua'' (see option script). If the script
is missing, or there is a syntax or memory error, then smtpe will fail
to start.

When an SMTP client connects, a new Lua thread is created from the
master Lua state. The each Lua hook back into smtpe is optional, ie.
doesn't need to be defined.


Client Connection Variables
---------------------------

client.address

	Available from hook.accept to hook.close

client.port

	Available from hook.accept to hook.close

client.host

	Available from hook.accept to hook.close

client.local_address

	Available from hook.accept to hook.close

client.id_sess

	Session ID available from hook.accept to hook.close

client.id_trans

	Transaction ID available from hook.mail to hook.forward;
	discarded by RSET, HELO, EHLO, or end of transaction.

client.msg_file

	Available from hook.data to hook.forward; discarded by RSET,
	HELO, EHLO, or end of transaction.

client.input

	Available in each SMTP command related hook (HELO, EHLO, AUTH,
	MAIL, RCPT, DATA, QUIT, RSET, NOOP, HELP, XCLIENT, unknown, error).

client.is_pipelining

	True when the client has been detected pipelining SMTP commands.

client.write(smtp_reply_string)

	Send a correctly formated SMTP reply to the client. Intended as
	an alternative means to send multi-line replies. For example

		for _, value in ipairs(output) do
			client.write("214-" .. value .. "\r\n")
		end

		return "214 end"

	Note that this function is equivalent to:

		function client.write(msg)
			if service.client.write(msg, timeout) do
				service.wait(1)
				service.reset()
			end
		end


Client SMTP Input Hooks
-----------------------

A hook can return either a correctly formatted SMTP (multi-line) reply
with CRLF newline or no reply. If no reply message is returned, or there
is an error, then a default reply is sent back to the client. Undefined
hooks are ignored.

A hook can optionally return a boolean before the reply. When true the
SMTP client connection will be dropped after the reply has been written
back to the client.

hook.init()

	Called on smtpe start-up. Note there is no client context and no
	Lua state is retained. This hook simply allows the engine to
	initialise the extenal application environment and preload
	dynamic libraries.


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.accept(ip, ptr)

	ip = client.address; ptr = client.host


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.helo(helo_arg)


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.ehlo(helo_arg)


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.auth(auth_arg)

	Should return 235 for successful authentication.


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.out_seq(smtp_input)

	Should always return 501 out of sequence.


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.unknown(smtp_input)

	Should always return 502 command unknown.


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.mail(sender, domain)

	Sender will be the original unmodified MAIL FROM: argument. The
	sender and domain may be an empty string in the case of a null
	sender. Domain will always be in lower case and should only
	appear as an empty string for the null sender; ie. unqualified
	senders should not be accepted.


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.rcpt(recipient, domain)

	Recipient will be the original unmodified RCPT TO: argument.
	Domain will always be in lower case and may be an empty string
	in the case of unqualified recipient.


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.data()

	Should return "354 text" to continue, "4xy text", or "5xy text".


hook.content(chunk_of_lines_as_a_string)


hook.header(header_line)


hook.eoh()


hook.body(body_line)


[drop_flag,] reply = hook.dot(spool_file_path)

	A negative reply will skip forwarding of the message. No reply
	or a positive reply will continue and forward the message. The
	possitive reply is held until the result of forwarding is known.
	hook.forward() may override the reply with its own positive or
	negative reply.

[drop_flag,] reply = hook.forward(spool_file_path, sender, accepted_recipients[])

	If no reply or a Lua error, then the smtp-smart-host option, if
	defined is used to forward the message. A positive or negative
	reply will skip smtp-smart-host forwarding.

hook.reset()

	Invoked for RSET, HELO, EHLO, and end of message (DOT).

[drop_flag,] reply = hook.rset()

	Should always return 250 OK.

[drop_flag,] reply = hook.noop()

	Should always return 250 OK.

[drop_flag,] reply = hook.help()

	Should always return 214 text.

[drop_flag,] reply = hook.quit()

	Should always return 221 text.

[drop_flag,] reply = hook.xclient()

	A negative reply will prevent the XCLIENT command from being
	applied.

hook.error(errno, errno_text)


hook.reply(reply_line)


hook.close(was_dropped)

	End of SMTP connection and clean-up.

header.delete(header_name, instance)

	Delete the Nth (1-based) instance of a header.

header.modify(header_name, instance, new_value)

	Insert, modify, or append the Nth instance of a header. If the
	instance is zero (0) insert the header at the front of the
	group. If the Nth instance does not exist, then append the
	header to the end of that group.

index, value = header.find(header_name, instance)

	Find the Nth (1-based) instance of a header. Return the index
	in the array of headers and the header string found; otherwise
	nil, nil if not found.


MD5 Functions
-------------

md5_obj = md5.new()


md5_obj:append(string)

Text API
--------

offset = text.find(haystack, needle, caseless)

	Find the first occurence of "needle" in "haystack" and return
	the offset into the haystack where found; otherwise zero (0).

	An astrisk (*) acts as wildcard, scanning over zero or more
	bytes. A question-mark (?) matches any single character; a
	space ( ) will match any single white space character.

	A left square bracket ([) starts a character class that ends
	with a right square bracket (]) and matches one character from
	the class. If the first character of the class is a carat (^),
	then the remainder of character class is negated. If the first
	character (after a carat if any) is a right square bracket, then
	the right square bracket is a literal and loses any special
	meaning. If the first character (after a carat and/or right
	square bracket) is a hypen (-), then the hyphen is a literal and
	loses any special meaning. A range expression expressed as a
	start character followed by a hyphen followed by an end
	character matches a character in character-set order between
	start and end characters inclusive.

	A backslash followed by any character treats that character as a
	literal (it loses any special meaning).

	(If you need more than that, think about using regex(3) instead.)

		"abc"		exact match for "abc"

		"abc*"		match "abc" at start of string

		"*abc"		match "abc" at the end of string

		"abc*def"	match "abc" at the start and match "def"
				at the end, maybe with stuff in between.

		"*abc*def*"	find "abc", then find "def"

		"a[]]c"		exact match for "a]c", same as "a]c"

		"[abc]"		match a single "a", "b", or "c".

		"[^abc]"	match a single charcater except "a", "b", or "c".

		"[a-z]"		match a single character "a" through "z" (assumes ASCII)

		"[0-9]"		match a single digit "0" through "9" (assumes ASCII)

		"[-ac]"		match a single charcater "-", "a", or "c".

		"[]-ac]		match a single charcater "]", "-", "a", or "c".

		"[^-ac]"	match a single charcater except "-", "a", or "c".

		"[^]-ac]"	match a single charcater execpt "]", "-", "a", or "c".


diff = text.natcmp(s1, s2, caseless)

	Return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
	according to whether the string s1 is greater than, equal to, or
	less than the string s2 according to natural sorting order.

	Note that either s1 or s2 can be nil, in which case nil equals nil
	and nil is greater than anything else; this means nil would sort
	to the end of an array of strings.


array = text.split(string, delims)

	The given string contains a list of substrings separated by the
	specified delimiter characters. The substrings may contain quoted
	strings and/or contain backslash-escaped characters. The common
	backslash escape sequences are supported and return their ASCII
	values.


URI
---

table = uri.parse(string)

	Attempt to parse the given URI string into its component parts.
	If the string is not a URI, then nil is returned.

		table.uri_raw
		table.uri_decoded
		table.scheme
		table.scheme_info
		table.user_info
		table.host
		table.port
		table.query
		table.fragment

string = uri.encode(string)


string = uri.decode(string)


uri.found

	This array is created when a transaction starts with MAIL and is
	discarded by RSET, HELO, EHLO, or at the end of message when the
	transaction completes. An array of unique uri entries. The
	number of entries given by "# uri.found".

uri.found[i] = md5_key

	For each URI found, the uri_raw field is converted to an MD5 and
	used as a key by which to save the URI. The MD5 is added to the
	table, primarily so that the Lua length operator, #, works. By
	using the MD5 of the uri_raw as a key, it allows for an
	existance test so as to avoid duplicate entries.

		uri.found[md5_key].uri_raw
		uri.found[md5_key].uri_decoded
		uri.found[md5_key].scheme
		uri.found[md5_key].scheme_info
		uri.found[md5_key].user_info
		uri.found[md5_key].host
		uri.found[md5_key].port
		uri.found[md5_key].query
		uri.found[md5_key].fragment
		uri.found[md5_key].mime_part	-- 0 for message headers

	To walk through the table:

		for k,v in pairs(uri.found) do
			if type(k) ~= "number" then
				-- operate on uri[k]
			end
		end


Utility Support
---------------

integer = util.cpucount()


array[3] = util.getloadavg()

	The array can also be accessed by field name, instead of index:

		array.1m_avg
		array.5m_avg
		array.15m_avg

boolean = util.mkpath(string)

	The absolute or relative directory path to create. True on
	success.

length[, integer] = util.date_to_time(string)

	Convert an RFC 2822 Date & Time string into seconds from the epoch.
	Return the length of the parsed portion of the string and a number
	of seconds from the epoch; otherwise return a zero length if the
	string could not be parsed.

	This conforms:		Sun, 21 Sep 2003 22:04:27 +0200

	Obsolete form:		Sun, 21 Sep 03 11:30:38 GMT	(named zone)

	Bad, but supported:	Mon Sep 22 01:39:09 2003 -0000	(ctime() + zone)

	Not supported:		Mon, 22 Sep 2003 20:02:33 PM	(AM/PM not zones)

	Not supported:		Mon 22 Sep 20:02:33 CDT 2003	(year & zone out of order)

	The following formats are supported:

		[www[,]] dd mmm yyyy [HH:MM:SS [zzzzzz]]
		[www[,]] mmm dd HH:MM:SS yyyy [zzzzzz]
