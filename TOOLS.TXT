The Unmentioned LibSnert Tools				25 July 2016
==============================

LibSnert has several command line interface (CLI) tools that are used
to test the APIs, but are also useful for scripting solutions. These
tools have no documentation other than their usage descriptions and
now this brief overview.

Typically just type the tool name shows the options, but some that
read from standard input won't display the usage unless an invalid
option is given, like "-?".

So here is a quick run down of some of the more interesting tools in
LibSnert that people can play with:

ansi		A pumped up echo(1) that does only ANSI (vt100)
		terminal escape. For example:

		ansi bold say something clever normal bell lf

bitdump		Bit stream dump.

b64		Yet another Base64 encoder/decoder.

cipher		An API and CLI for the paper & pencil cipher techniques
		used by VIC, SECOM, and PPN ciphers. See
		http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/handciphers.htm

clamstream	Yet another tool to stream a message to clamd server.

convertDate	Converts textual date string into seconds; the reverse
		of date(1) and strftime(3). Supports RFC 2822, ctime,
		and ISO 8601 formats.

dnsd		A simple UDP only DNS server intended for implementing
		black & white lists. Supports A, AAAA, and TXT records.
		This is still pretty raw "work in progress".

flip		Yet another newline flipper for DOS, old Mac, and Unix.

geturl		A simple HTTP retrieval program similar to wget(1).

inplace		A simple tool that takes a shell command line argument
		and one or more files to modify "inplace".  The most
		common example is when you want to use sed to modify a
		file typically:

			sed 's/teh/the/' file >tmp
			mv tmp file

		But now you can simplify the use of a temporary file
		with:

			inplace "sed 's/teh/the/" file

		(I know GNU sed has an option to do this, but BSD sed
		does not and many other command line tools can't do it.)

ixhash		Generate iXhash checksums, typically used for anti-spam
		filtering and testing against iXhash blacklists.
		http://ixhash.sourceforge.net/

kvmap		Key-value map tool similar to makemap(1) or postmap(1).
		Supports a variety of formats.

kvmd		Key-value map extended-socketmap daemon. Supports the
		same source formats at kvmap.

kvmc		Key-value map extended-socketmap client. The extended
		socketmap protocol is outlined in type/socketmap.txt.

Luhn		Validates and generates Luhn checksums for numbers
		and/or text. Think credit-card check digit. This was
		the predecessor to a Luhn.php class I needed a few
		years ago for an online store.

mailgroup	Originally intended for use with Sendmail aliases to
		provide the ability to deliver mail to the members of
		a system group id or name. Could be used from the
		command line to broadcast mail to a group.

mcc		Multicast/unicast cache server and control.

mime		A MIME part extractor.

mimepart	Predecessor to the mime tool above. Deprecated.

myip		Simple inetd service reports IPv4 or IPv6 address and
		port number. If the server port is 80 or any port
		between 8000..8999, then treat it as an HTTP request.

natsort		Natural sort test tool sorts lines of text.

netcontainsip	Simple tool to test if a given IPv4 or IPv6 address is
		a member of the given IPv6 or IPv4 net/cidr.

nctee		Interleave netcat client input with the server output.

pad		Simple tool to pad leading and trailing padding with
		byte and column width restrictions.

pdq		Parallel Domain Query; does DNS lookups similar to
		dig(1), but in a parallel manner, especially with DNS
		based black/white lists.

playfair	An implementation of the paper & pencil Playfair cipher.
		Can be used as a second stage substitution cipher for
		Victor. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher

popin		POP3 interface mail retrieval tool. I originally used
		this with smtpout (replaced by smtp2) to test a "mail
		send & receive circuit" with Nagios (see mail-cycle.sh).

secho		Secure echo test client and server. Note that server can
sechod		only handle a single connection at a time (no threads,
		no forking) since it was only intended for testing. The
		client first connects in clear text and forwards standard
		input to the server, which in turn simply echos back the
		data. The client can specify a line with ".starttls" to
		switch to TLS and continue to send and recieve data over
		an encrypted channel.

sqlargs		An xargs(1) like tool that queries a data source for
		arguments to be used in a command substitution. Each
		row from the data source will invoke one instance of
		the command (default is to echo the row to standard
		output), with a limit as to how many instances of the
		command may be running at a time. Currently works with
		.csv or .sq3 files.

show		Similar to head(1) and tail(1). Can highlight and/or
		beep when a constant pattern is seen. Was intended for
		watching heavy volume logs and/or catch when a rare
		pattern might appear.

sift
		Log file monitoring tool.

siq		CLI version of milter-siq.

smtp2		An SMTP mail engine.

spf		SPF Classic, essentially CLI version of milter-spiff.

TextFind	General pattern matching similar to glob(3). See the
		function description of TextFind for an overview of the
		supported meta-characters.

uue		Yet another UUE encoder/decoder.

uri		CLI version of milter-link. Can also be used as a CGI,
		see uri-cgi.txt.

urid		Dedicated HTTP / URI server; see uri-cgi.txt.

uriFormat	CLI tool for RFC 6570 (level 3) URI template parsing
		and expansion.

cmp, cksum, comm, echo, kat, tee, strings
		Unix tool clones intended for use with Windows CLI when
		you don't have Cygwin or similar Unix tool set.

ziplist, rarlist
		ZIP & RAR file format test tools.


There are other tools lying about the LibSnert source tree, but those
mentioned here are just some of the more interesting ones that people
might find useful or just curious about. While some tools are clones
of classic Unix tools, the majority can all be built as Windows native
binaries for use in Windows batch files and cmd.exe; ie. no cygwin.dll
required.
