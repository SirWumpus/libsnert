URI CGI & HTTP Daemon Overview
==============================

Request By File
---------------
GET /uri/?p=[01]&q=[01]&v=[01]&x=[01]&f=/abs-path HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
Host: www.weeder.example:8088<CRLF>
<CRLF>


Request By File (equivalent)
----------------------------
HEAD /uri/?p=[01]&q=[01]&v=[01]&x=[01]&f=/abs-path HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
Host: www.weeder.example:8088<CRLF>
<CRLF>


Request By Message
------------------
POST /uri/?p=[01]&q=[01]&v=[01]&x=[01] HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
Host: www.weeder.example:8088<CRLF>
Content-Type: message/rfc822<CRLF>
Content-Length: NNNN<CRLF>
<CRLF>
complete message
with headers and
content follows


URL Options
-----------

f=/abs_path	Path of a local file to parse.

p=1		Dump each URI parsed in as body content.
p=2 		Dump each URI parsed in as body content and redo lookups.

q=1		Check URL query part for embedded URLs.

v=1		Verbose debugging in body content. (CGI only)

x=N		Stop after Nth list hit; default 1.


CGI-only Optional Request Headers
---------------------------------
These headers present alternative blacklist suffix lists to override
the default CGI configuration options.

A-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	*Reserved* does not apply to normal URI. SpamHaus IP BL format.

Domain-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	A list of domain black list suffixes to consult, like
	.dbl.spamhaus.org. The host or domain name found in a URI is
	checked against these DNS black lists. These black lists are
	assumed to use wildcards entries, so only a single lookup is
	done. IP-as-domain in a URI are ignored.

URI-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	A list of domain name black list suffixes to consult, like
	.multi.surbl.org. The domain name found in a URI is checked
	against these DNS black lists.

URI-A-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	A list of IP black list suffixes to consult, like
	zen.spamhaus.org. The host or domain name found in a URI is used
	to find its DNS A record and IP address, which is then checked
	against these IP DNS black lists.

URI-NS-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	A list of host name and/or domain name black list suffixes to
	consult. The domain name found in a URI is used to find its DNS
	NS records; the NS host names are checked against these host
	name and/or domain name DNS black lists.

URI-NS-A-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	A list of IP black list suffixes to consult, like
	zen.spamhaus.org. The host or domain name found in a URI is used
	to find its DNS A record and IP address, which is then checked
	against these IP DNS black lists.

Mail-BL: bl_suffix0, bl_suffix1 ...
	A list of mail address black list suffixes to consult. The mail
	addresses found in select headers and the message are MD5
	hashed, which are then checked against these black lists.

Mail-BL-Domains: glob0, glob1 ...
	A list of domain glob-like patterns for which to test against
	mail-bl, typically free mail services. This reduces the load on
	public BLs. Specify * to test all domains, empty list to
	disable.

Mail-BL-Headers: header0, header1, ...
	A list of mail headers to parse for mail addresses and check
	against one or more mail address black lists. Specify the empty
	list to disable.


List Hit
--------
HTTP/1.0 204 No Content<CRLF>
Uri-Found: line_no complete_URI_found0[ ; blacklist_suffix]<CRLF>
Uri-Found: line_no complete_URI_found1[ ; blacklist_suffix]<CRLF>
...
Uri-Found: line_no complete_URI_foundN[ ; blacklist_suffix]<CRLF>
Blacklist-Hits: NNN<CRLF>
<CRLF>


List Hit & Parse Output
-----------------------
HTTP/1.0 200 OK<CRLF>
Content-Type: text/plain
Uri-Found: line_no complete_URI_found0[ ; blacklist_suffix]<CRLF>
Uri-Found: line_no complete_URI_found1[ ; blacklist_suffix]<CRLF>
...
Uri-Found: line_no complete_URI_foundN[ ; blacklist_suffix]<CRLF>
Blacklist-Hits: NNN<CRLF>
<CRLF>
uri -p output follows<CRLF>


Nothing Found
-------------
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found<CRLF>
<CRLF>


Dump Daemon Runtime Blacklist Hits
----------------------------------

GET /uri/stat/ HTTP/1.0<CRLF>
Host: www.weeder.example:8088<CRLF>
<CRLF>

Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK<CRLF>
Content-Type: text/plain<CRLF>
<CRLF>
00000<TAB>dbl.spamhaus.org.<CRLF>
00000<TAB>multi.surbl.org.<CRLF>
00000<TAB>black.uribl.com.<CRLF>


Daemon Syslog Format
--------------------

$session_id $client_ip "$http_request_line" $http_status $hits/$found

For example:

o1KFA0139260000100 192.168.1.16 "GET / HTTP/1.0" 404 0/0
o1KFAw139260000200 192.168.1.16 "GET /uri/stat/ HTTP/1.0" 200 0/0
o1KFDm139260000400 192.168.1.16 "POST /uri/?p=0&q=1&x=3 HTTP/1.0" 204 0/1

The $session_id format is

	ymd HMS ppppp sssss cc

where y, m, d, H, M, and S are unique over a 62-year cycle. The 'cc' portion
in the context of this daemon will always be zero-zero (00).
