/**
 * Parse the string for the next token. A token consists of characters
 * not found in the set of delimiters. It may contain backslash-escape
 * sequences, which shall be converted into literals or special ASCII
 * characters. It may contain single or double quoted strings, in which
 * case the quotes shall be removed, though any backslash escape
 * sequences within the quotes are left as is.
 *
 * @param string
 *	A quoted string.
 *
 * @param stop
 *	A pointer to a C string pointer. The point were the scan stops
 *	is passed back through this argument. This pointer can be NULL.
 *
 * @param delims
 *	A set of delimiter characters.
 *
 * @param flags
 *
 *	TOKEN_KEEP_EMPTY
 *
 *	If not set, then a run of one or more delimeters is treated as a
 *	single delimeter separating tokens. Otherwise each delimeter
 *	separates a token that may be empty.
 *
 *	string		true		false
 *	-------------------------------------------
 *	[a,b,c]		[a] [b] [c]	[a] [b] [c]
 *	[a,,c]		[a] [] [c]	[a] [c]
 *	[a,,]		[a] [] [] 	[a]
 *	[,,]		[] [] []	(null)
 *	[]		[]		(null)
 *
 *	TOKEN_KEEP_BACKSLASH
 *
 *	The token might have backslash escapes that are suppose to be
 *	part of the token, like a regex string /RE/ where you need to
 *	keep any "\/" between the open and closing slashes. We still
 *	need to recognise escapes and not convert them to a literal.
 *
 *	TOKEN_KEEP_QUOTES
 *	
 *	Similar to TOKEN_KEEP_BACKSLASH; need to recognise qoutes
 *	and not remove them.
 *
 *	TOKEN_IGNORE_QUOTES
 *
 *	Disable any special processing of quoted substrings; quotes
 *	are treated as literals.
 *
 *	TOKEN_KEEP_ASIS
 *
 *	Shorthand for TOKEN_KEEP_BACKSLASH | TOKEN_IGNORE_QUOTES.
 *
 *	TOKEN_KEEP_BRACKETS
 *
 *	Split strings with brackets, keeping the open and close:
 *	parenthesis, "(" and ")"; angle brackets, "<" and ">"; square
 *	brackets, "[" and "]"; and/or braces, "{" and "}" grouped
 *	together. Both open and close brackets must in the set of
 *	delimiters. For example:
 *
 *	string		delims	vector
 *	-------------------------------------------
 *	"a{b}c"		"{}"	"a", "{b}", "c"
 *	"a{{b}}c"	"{}"	"a", "{{b}}", "c"
 *	"a{{b\{c}}d"	"{}"	"a", "{{b{c}}", "d"
 *	"a{{b[(<c}}d"	"{}"	"a", "{{b[(<c}}", "d"
 *	"a{b{c}{d}e}f"	"{}"	"a", "{b{c}{d}e}", "f"
 *	"<>a{b<c>d}<e>"	"{}<>"	"<>", "a", "{b<c>d}", "<e>", ""
 *
 * @return
 *	An allocated token.
